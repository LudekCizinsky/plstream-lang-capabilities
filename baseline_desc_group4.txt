- As our baseline model, we ended up using 'Logistic regression'
- The data is loaded as a list of raw reviews and list of corresponding labels
  where labels where encoded to integers
- The system for Logistic Regression was designed as a short pipeline, where the
  raw reviews are transformed using 'CountVectorizer' with its default settings
  which represents each review as BOW.
- The best set of hyper-parameters (different number of iterations and different strenghts of regularization)
  was found using 'GridSearch' from sklearn. The best model achieved cross validated (5 folds) F1 score: 0.94.
- We then used the model to make a prediction on test data, we mapped the
  predictions back to actual values and saved it to the required format
