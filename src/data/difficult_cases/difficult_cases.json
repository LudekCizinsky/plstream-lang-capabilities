{"reviewText": "Kid Rock improves from the last album, but only just. I hated to rate Kid Rock's last album \"Born Free\" so low, but nothing on that album stood out to me as something that would be a classic, it may have gone to #1 in the US and done fairly well around the world, but that was fans anticipation that Kid's latest album would be great, but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now, how many have radio play, how many clips where made and remembered and the singles chart positions.I am glad Kid Rock abandoned using Rick Ruban's help to produce this album, as it does sound a bit more like Kid Rock now. However, I was excited to not only hear that, but that Kid wanted this album to be something more like \"Cocky\" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to that album almost from start to finish. But what has been the outcome here on \"Rebel Soul\" has been rather disappointing for me.The opening song \"Chickens In The Pen\" is not a strong opener, nor is it a great song. Usually upon hearing the first track of an album, it sets the mood for what is about to come, but like on \"Born Free\" the first track here made my heart sink that this album was not going to put Kid back on top of his game. The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track. I thought maybe it would be tongue in cheek lyrics, but \"the mule keeps kickin' the chickens in the pen, Let's rock all night and then do it again\" I dunno... I just expect better from Kid Rock. The song is just too stupid to be good if you ask me.Lets Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60's and 70's sound of Rock N roll bands like 'The Who' and 'Alice Cooper'. It's certainly not a bad thing at all, however the song comes off sounding pretty average for it's genre.Catt Boogie - About the same as \"Lets Ride\", its decent, but not all that memorable.Detroit Michigan - OK, KID. WE GET IT ALREADY, YOU ARE FROM DETROIT, BUT PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop singing about it. The lyrics sound good, the melody is pretty good, up until the chorus, it just doesn't sit right in the song. A song that could have been good, but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the album.Rebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock, but it sounds country to me. Kid's done some great country songs, but this song here to me is not worthy of naming the whole album after. Definitely a filler sounding track.God Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock, yet this one here has ROCK N ROLL in the title and is a country tune? Next.Happy New Year - This is a cover song? Why did Kid chose to cover this song? It's pretty simple lyrics, and i'm convinced Kid can do much better then this. I was surprised to see this song was leading the votse of favorite song from this album on Kid's website... why, I just don't know?Celebrate - Not a bad song, but like track 2 and 3, it is easy to forget, but amongst the rest of this album, it's one of the better ones on here.The Mirror - I absolutely hate auto-tuners. Kid doesn't need to use them, and ruined what could have been a decent slow song had he not used those annoying stupid auto-tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with. I did say something the same on Alice Cooper's last album, and was informed that it was an effect and not an auto-tuner, so if that's the case with this song too, then Bathroom Bobby, never EVER use that effect ever again, it sounds horrible.Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith that there wasn't going to be a stand out song on this album, and i'd be reviewing it the same way I did Kid's last album, but Mr Rock N Roll showed up and brightened my day. I wouldn't say this song is 5 of 5 stars, but it's around the 4 mark. It's my favorite track on this album, and easy to get into and rock with. The lyrics are great, has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it, and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows.Cucci Galore - At first I thought, WTF is this $#!%? lyrics spewing out of \"My names Cucci, Cucci, Cucci galore\" and repeating. Then a screaming rock chorus of \"Do you wanna go down\"... the song makes little sense to me other than it's a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money, fame, women and hot tubs etc... but as weird as the lyrics are, and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen... for some reason, it's not a bad track, as much as it makes little sense, it's catchy.. and about the only song on here that has any boom bass in it, where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock or country sounding, this one combines a bit of rock with a sort of hip hop beat to it. Weirdly, this track grew on me!Redneck Paradise - Euhhh, seems like Kid has done this song before. I'd rather better red neck songs about drinking or \"Born To Be a Hick\" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing-along filler.Cocaine and Gin - Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I take back that thing I said about rather listening to drinking songs... only when they rock, this one is just a filler for boredom.Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point that I just can't even get to the end of this track. Not a good way to close the album. Kid has said he wants this song played at his funeral, I would take \"Only God Knows Why\" over this any day and any night.I added up my ratings, and can only give this album a 1.9... a bit higher then the last album, but far from the 4 to 5 star ratings for albums Kid has done in the past. Just to be clear, no, I am not a rap or hip hop fan, so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter, but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like \"So Hott\", \"American Baddass\" and Kid's earlier album sounds... I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band... plus, what I would have loved to hear was songs like on \"Cocky\" that started off slow, then rocked your @$$ off by the end. Hopefully Kid Rock will return to that sound on the next album. But even so, the songs on here, there are a few decent tracks, but only one or two worthy of being included during live shows, but only barely worthy of being called a hit song... not something I would be disappointed by if they didn't appear on a greatest hits album in future... but compared to Kid's best stuff, really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them... but again, not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection.", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "typos"}

{"reviewText": "A label of the UPMOST importance to abstract hip-hop & art.. ..Mo' Wax's past was/is groundbreaking just like other labels that brought a new dimension on music, such as Mush Records, Stones Throw, WARP records, Rough Trade, etc. They approached all their releases with attention to art/design (Ben D. and Futura 2000!) just as well as the sound. To this day if I come across a Mo' Wax release I usually pick it up (most of their seminal material is out of print).The release featured here was a continuation of a previous 2 record/disc comp. simply titled \"Headz: 1a & 1b\". The two discs packed with classic tracks and hosts a strong group of artists (see Amazon track listing!) although Shadow only appears once (I believe) under the U.N.K.L.E. guise to help produce a Massive Attack remix. Some names are monikesr for other artists (i.e. \"Olde Scottish = Howie B\"). Almost completely instrumental (abeit 1 or 2 tracks) the collection wonderfully showcases the music force of the genre.Sadly, Mo' Wax sort of went under, although the label still releases recordings here and there. Founder James Lavelle still (the main man from U.N.K.L.E. of course) hasn't captured the vibe of his earlier A&R days, but maybe he should be left to rest on his laurels after an amazing run.If you come across it used, pick it up and hopefully you'll agree.", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "typos"}

{"reviewText": "Still a CLASSIC! What can I say? I just received the autographed copy of this landmark recording I purchased from janhammer.com and I am in heaven. This is undoubtedly one of my favorite albums of all time but it has been years since I gave it a listen mainly because my vinyl copy was played to death, literally. On CD for the first time, and digitally remastered, this album sounds better than it ever could have when I first bought it in the mid-seventies.Sounds that might have sounded dated 10 years ago have come full circle now and this testament to musical genius is right in its element with an amazing mix of piano, mellotron, moog and a host of synthesizers with that distinctive 70s edge. Often atmospheric in nature the seven tracks that make up The First Seven Days rely on masterful musical and sonic construction to evoke moods and images wholly consistent with the narrative the album represents.Jan Hammer demonstrates his unrivalled genisu on so many levels: as a composer, performer (no one could do so much with a moog - NO ONE), producer and even in the way he brings sounds together to create whatever emotion it is that he wishes you to experience. For fans of Jan Hammer, fans of great music or fans of new age and synthesizer music this is a milestone in musical evolution which should be experienced and remembered.  Kudos to Sony for bringing back. The First Seven Days is a classic in every sense of the word.", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "typos"}

{"reviewText": "I don't know if this album was ever released on CD.  I can't find it anywhere.  I only found the cassette and LP releases... ... Anyway, if you'd like to know more about the music this cassette came from, check this out...May 2017  Major Update!CLASSICAL TOMITA GUIDE with REVIEWSIn TOMITA's music I have found serene beauty, relaxation, landscapes of wonder, mysterious spaces, thrilling excitement, fascinating dimensions, inspiration, and some fun.  The music he creates is more natural, mellow, and rich, with more depth, color, imagery, feeling, and thought than any other synthesized music I have ever heard.  He makes classical music come alive, with never before seen, heard, or felt images and sounds.As a person who began collecting TOMITA and other electronic music when I was 18 in 1978, plus the original symphony orchestra versions of the classical music that TOMITA used, I hope you consider me qualified to create the following list of TOMITA albums and review them as well. Thank you all so much for the votes.Scroll down for the IMPORTANT and HELPFUL SOUND QUALITY COMPARISON BUYERS GUIDE, and more about Quadraphonic.SACD NOTEThe SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect. (I just double-checked.  That is accurate.)* * *MUSIC REVIEWSSNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 (Debussy)(11 Debussy pieces)I love the range of styles in this album, the relaxing beauty, the depth of colors.  The Snowflakes album is very enjoyable; one of the few CDs that I listen to again and again.  To me, SNOWFLAKES is in TOMITA's top three.The newly remastered HIGH PERFORMANCE CD from 2000 is 24/96 Audiophile Quality on any player, and adds Prelude To The Afternoon of a Faun, also by Debussy.CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid)Finally! A New TOMITA CD!!  And it is superb. It adds the never before released Second Arabesque (which is delightful fun as it should be), Whistle and Chime (The Art of Sound Creation), and Nauges.  This QUADRAPHONIC SACD is a completely new experience. Several of the original tracks feature new and different mixes by Mr. TOMITA.  Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Faun is missing, but this is a great new album!* * *PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975 (Mussorgsky)For this album (also in the top 3) TOMITA created some of the most unusual, high quality electronic sounds ever heard. Then he used these sounds very effectively in some amazing orchestrations. The listening is as enjoyable as it is bizarre, quite an accomplishment in itself. (Unlike other synthesized music, I have never gotten a headache listening to this or any other TOMITA recording.  Not even close.  Not even when playing his music loud, which I love to do.)PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid)(Moussorgsky: PICTURES. Rimsky-Korsakov: SCHEHERAZADE- excerpt of Part I. Bach-TOMITA: Sea Named Solaris- excerpt).Finally!!  For the first time ever, one of the most amazing Quadraphonic albums ever produced in magnificent Discrete 4-Channel Quadraphonic Sound!!!* * *FIREBIRD 1976 (various)(Stravinsky: FIREBIRD SUITE. Debussy: Prelude To The Afternoon of A Faun. Mussorgsky: Night On Bare Mountain.)FIREBIRD is one of TOMITA's best albums. The Round of the Princesses is beautiful. The Infernal Dance of King Kastchei is exciting, scary, and LOUD - much more so than any performance by any orchestra. The Finale is so awesome; TOMITA played it at the end of his live concerts.* * *THE PLANETS 1976 (Holst)THE PLANETS is a completely different mood for TOMITA, but he did a fantastic job on it.  Each time I hear any part of THE PLANETS performed by Symphony Orchestra, it sounds very two-dimensional and just falls flat compared to TOMITAs.  It is as if Holst composed THE PLANETS for TOMITA, even though the Holst family would not allow this album to be released in England. They didn't like that Uranus and Neptune were abridged, but the blending and poignant ending are pure genius, even more so in the new SACD...THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid)This New QUADRAPHONIC PLANETS album on SACD has a nice long new Introduction with Control Room, Spaceship Interior, Pre-Launch Communications, and beginning of Mars that knocked my socks off!  Theres even a brand new track called Itokawa and Hayabusa about the exploration of the Asteroid Belt between Jupiter and Saturn.  The whole new PLANETS album is just astounding. The Discrete 4-Channel Sound is phenomenal.  I couldn't have been more surprised, amazed, and delighted.* * *KOSMOS or COSMOS 1978 (various)(Star Wars Title. Space Fantasy - R. Strauss: Thus Spake Zarathustra, Wagner: Ride of The Valkyries and Tannhauser Overture. Honnegar: Pacific 231. Ives: Unanswered Question. Rodrigo: Aranjuez. Grieg: Solveig's Song. Dinicu-Heifetz: Hora Staccato. Bach-TOMITA: The Sea Named Solaris.)A Science Fiction album without a theme, and quite a variety of experiences...In this album:  Star Wars is cute.  The Space Fantasy awesome and exhilerating.  Pacific 231 exciting and fun, a quality piece.  You can see and feel the mechanical motions of the locomotive flying through space after the train speeds up, leaves the tracks and goes to another dimension...  TOMITA's interpretation of the mystery and solitude of The Unanswered Question is far better than any orchestral performance.  Hora Staccato is lots of fun.  And Carl Sagan respected the amazing Sea Named Solaris so much, that he used it in his COSMOS. All TOMITA fans and collectors should enjoy most of this CD.SPACE FANTASY 2015 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid)Tomita was 83 when he re-arranged and re-mixed his KOSMOS album for SACD.  I think its remarkable that he was still working, but I feel I must reluctantly share why you may want to skip this one...1.  No Thus Spake Zarathustra (the 2001 Movie Theme) which had worked so well at the beginning of his Space Fantasy piece on KOSMOS.2.  No Sea Named Solaris because 5:19 of the original 12:26 was on The PICTURES SACD.3.  Two random tracks from THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE indicates that it may never have its own Quadraphonic SACD release.  (Someone please re-release the entire Bermuda Triangle in Quadraphonic on SACD.  It is my all time favorite album from any genre.)4.  On CD 2 we have some never before heard tracks from Walt Disneys FANTASIA, but with only one part from THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, three parts from THE NUTRACKER SUITE, and no Dance Of The Hours or RITE OF SPRING... The whole CD is only 22:05 long.5.  The Waltz of The Flowers fades abruptly a full minute before its done.* * *THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979 - A MUSICAL FANTASY of SCIENCE FICTION(Sibelius: Valse Triste. Williams: Close Encounters. Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet, Scythian Suite, Symphonies 5 and 6, Violin Concerto 1.)After nearly 30 years of listening to THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE off and on, I have decided that it is my all time favorite record album, CD, concept album, and my all time favorite synthesized music.Inexplicably, the U.S. Dolby Surround CD releases stopped with KOSMOS. THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is much better than KOSMOS. I could type pages on THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, and you can find many pages on various websites.  But I will just say that the orchestrations and performances of the music itself all fit together masterfully to tell a story that is part thrilling Science Fiction and part Impressionistic Dream.  I especially like the second half - the exceptional, exciting Prokofiev music. The sounds TOMITA created for this album are his most sophisticated and fascinating yet (maybe ever). The quality of the recording is bright, full, deep, clear, and clean. The whole experience is extraordinary. I am so grateful the album is on CD.Another reviewer is absolutely right...  Turn off the lights, put the phone on silent, turn the volume way up, and sit down and listen!  Really listen!!  Because THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is an Experience: A Phenomenal, Powerful, Enlightening, Enjoyable Experience!!* * *DAPHNIS AND CHLOE or BOLERO or THE RAVEL ALBUM 1980 (Ravel)(Ravel: DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, Pavane for A Dead Princess, Bolero, MOTHER GOOSE SUITE.)This is a very good album with the best performance of THE MOTHER GOOSE SUITE that I have heard, by far.  I love the range of musical styles in it.  You can actually hear the fairies in the Fairy Garden (they sound like hummingbirds).  Plus, this DAPHNIS AND CHLOE is better than some orchestral performances.OKHOTSK FANTASY 2016 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid)Many of us Tomita fans wondered why he put a mono recording of an old cartoon on the OKHOTSK FANTASY album, instead of doing a DAPHNIS AND CHLOE - ULTIMATE EDITION in discrete 4.1 channel Quadraphonic sound... Now it is clear, the OKHOTSK FANTASY album was his last.  It was released in March 2016, and he passed away two months later.  So he probably wasn't able to finish it.  Knowing this, we can wish that he had started putting his Quadraphonic albums on SACD sooner, but we cant blame him for the last two SACDs, because he was 83 and 84 when he did them.So, there is no DAPHNIS AND CHLOE SUITE on this SACD.  But thankfully, the entire MOTHER GOOSE SUITE is on this album with spectacular Quadraphonic sound. The Fairy Garden is just unbelievable in Quadraphonic.(Please RCA or Denon:  Remix and release Ultimate Edition SACDs of ALL of Tomitas wonderful Quadraphonic Classical Albums with complete FIREBIRD SUITE, DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, GRAND CANYON, and the complete BERMUDA TRIANGLE in 4.1 Surround on SACD.)* * *THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe)(Bonus track: Syncopated Clock by Leroy Anderson is not on the Japan Import CD.)The average music critic might say that this performance of THE GRAND CANYON Suite is not as good as a symphony orchestra's. But it is worth checking out, as parts of it are far more colorful, magical, and entertaining than any symphony orchestra version I have ever heard. TOMITA's Painted Desert gives a feeling of flying low over vast mysterious, enchanted, moonlit sands. On The Trail is a lot of fun, although some orchestra performances may be a bit better. And the Thunderstorm is exhilarating and even a little frightening, especially when turned up Loud. You can actually HEAR the Lightning, FEEL the Thunder, and then SEE a Rainbow at the end. Only TOMITA could do that!!  This is the shortest TOMITA album. It would easily fit on a CD with CANON OF THE THREE STARS.* * *CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (various)(Pachelbel: Canon. Rachmaninoff: Vocalise. Albinoni: Adagio. Bach: Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring. Three movements from Villa Lobos: BACHIANAS BRASILEIRAS Suites 2, 4, and 7.)Sweet is the word I would use to describe pretty much this whole album. Some tracks are even cute, although at least one is solemn and another poignant.  The quality of this album is not nearly as great as his early albums...  It almost seems that TOMITA did this one in his sleep, but some tracks are very good, and since all the tracks are individual pieces, it is very worth owning as a reference CD.* * *LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1984 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE (various)(Live concert with huge speakers on both sides of the Danube River. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and Live Soloists.  Plus 5 Totally New Pieces...  Stravinsky: Dance of the Young Girls from THE RITE OF SPRING. Japanese Traditional: Cranes In Their Nest.  Vaughn Williams: The Lark Ascending.  Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod.  Beethoven: ODE TO JOY with full Choir and soloists.)In my opinion, this is in TOMITA's top five best albums. It contains some of the most beautiful and unique performances ever put on a disk. The live violin solo (Mariko Senju) of The Lark Ascending at least equals the best performance I ever heard. The same violinist does an outstanding job on Prokofiev's VIOLIN CONCERTO NO. 1.  This is the part of THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE near the end that gets so exciting, and with the live violinist and TOMITA's magical orchestral creations, it is truly one of the most thrilling musical experiences I have ever enjoyed.I also love the Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod (which first appeared on this album).  So much depth and feeling, it is hard to describe how lovely it is.  This album also has an extended version of Cranes In Their Nest (probably because it is also on the Voyager Interstellar Record) a very good performance by Goro Yamaguchi on the Shakuhachi (a Japanese end-blown flute made of bamboo).Of the two concert CDs, this one has more awe-inspiring moments, and more depth. It is also the longest TOMITA album ever made, which is nice, since it is so enjoyable.Note on LIVE AT LINZ Recording QualityI think that since MIND OF THE UNIVERSE was a live concert with speakers on both sides of the Danube River, a helicopter carrying a speaker above for a UFO effect, and a huge choir on a boat ...  there is no way the sound quality could have been perfect.  TOMITA's mixing choices could have been a bit better but even though I am particular about sound quality, I do enjoy listening to this CD very much.  And when I play my old 1985 Domestic Release CD (made in Japan with a black cover) Loud on my car sound system, it sounds great to me. The most important parts are clean.  There is reverb at times, but it is natural, bouncing off things in the area.  I have always given this one album more slack, because the oddities that occur make me FEEL as if I am at the Live Concert, and for me this is a plus.* * *LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH (various)(Live concert with live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus Dukas: Fanfare. Mahler: SYMPHONY 3 IN D MINOR  5th Movement. Traditional: Chinese War Lord Going Home. Gershwin: Rhapsody In Blue. Fisher-Dvorak: Goin' Home.)LIVE IN NY is almost as good as the LIVE AT LINZ concert (above).  Parts of it are great.  And the music is less demanding than LIVE AT LINZ, which makes it more suited for playing in the background.These last two CDs are my all time favorite live concert albums.* * *BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S. Bach)10 separate Bach pieces, which include only two tracks from previous albums, and part of The Sea Named Solaris is mixed different.Too bad this is hard to find and was not included in the big Box Set, but you CAN find it used on Amazon Japan, and G..... Chrome translates automatically, then with a little perseverance, you can figure out how to order from a seller who says they ship internationally.  Once I figured it out, it was easy, a great price, and in perfect condition.This CD features some new sounds, moods, and musical styles for TOMITA Classical - a really wide variety of them.  Several of the tracks are most enjoyable. The popular Toccata and Fugue is a very good, virtuoso straight performance on very cool sounding Synth Organ (which I normally would not appreciate, but TOMITA gets away with it splendidly).  My subwoofer liked it too!* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *SOUND QUALITY COMPARISONS OF MOST RELEASESWITH RECOMMENDATIONSHOW I COMPARED THE SOUND QUALITY OF VARIOUS CD RELEASESListening with Beyerdynamic DT990 Studio Headphones plugged into my Mac Pro, I played tracks from each pair of CDs using QuickTime Player 7 opened in two windows, and a keyboard command to switch back and forth (many times) for the comparisons.  I compared the SACDs and Surround CDs on my Surround System in the living room.* * *SACD NOTEThe SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect.

It is true.)* * *SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974CLAIR DE LUNE  ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES!Finally, True Quadraphonic for the first time ever for some of us!

The above definitions apply no matter what.THE POPULARITY OF DIFFERENT SACDsI think I know why SACDs never became popular First, they can only be played on a blu-ray player that plays SACDs.  And even if a person already has a player that can play SACDs, and it is connected to a Surround System in the living room where Quadraphonic music would be perfect, most SACDs only have a little bit of reverb in the rear channels, so they don't take advantage of that perfect set up.Now that I have heard TOMITAs SACDs though, I want to try Quadraphonic SACDs and DVD Audios in other genres.  But time and time again, I find that true Quadraphonic discs are very expensive, while the price of most SACDs with nothing in the rear channels is WAY down. What does THAT tell you??QUADRAPHONIC ON A BUDGETIf you're like me and never heard true Quadraphonic sound from a music album before these TOMITA SACDs... Now you have to!  And you can do it on a budget! On Amazon do a search for blu-ray player sacd in electronics, and choose 4 Stars under Avg. Customer Review (on the left)...  Then do the same kind of search for receiver 5.1... Then search for the best you found for a good price and...  When buying used, make sure you can return the item, and test it right after receiving it.If there are no HDMI connections on one component, thats OK.  Just make sure the blu-ray player and receiver have the same kind of output and input for Digital Sound, whether its Optical or RCA Coax...  Then add a good pair of speakers at ear level behind you, and a subwoofer.  Then connect the speakers with thick enough wires.  Then set your Receiver or Surround Decoder to auto detect the surround encoding, or set it to DSD, and be amazed!When Quadraphonic sound began, 4 large speakers were required and were usually placed in the 4 corners of the room with the listener in the center of the room.  Surround (Rear) Speakers these days are typically smaller, so its best when SACDs use the Subwoofer, and Tomitas SACDs do.* * *ON PRODUCING JVC K2 CDs (2004, 2006, and 2007)The source material was first converted to digital via JVC's patented K2 24-bit / 96kHz analog-to-digital converter, which uses advanced dither algorithms (without noise shaping). The musical information is next encoded on a magneto-optical disk for transport to JVC's Yokohama manufacturing plant. The musical signal on the disk is down-converted to 16-bit through a K2 \"super-coding\" process before going through a proprietary \"Extended Pit Cut\" DVD K2 laser technology to produce a glass master. This optimizes the linear velocity of the glass master, giving precise pit lengths to eliminate time jitters, controlled by an extremely precise Rubidium Clock. All CDs are finally stamped directly from this glass master.  These CDs are noticeably THICKER than the average music CD is now.* * * * * * * * * * * * *IN CONCLUSIONOther reviewers on Amazon have done a more eloquent job than I of describing TOMITA's amazing musical style, but I have enjoyed creating this guide.  I hope you enjoyed it too.Im flattered that this was copied and pasted to so many websites, but I would like you to know that I Am the original author.  Check the dates.  I first posted this on Amazon in March 2002. Thank You so much.And THANK YOU MR. TOMITA!There is no collection of music I enjoy more.  Not even close.Jeff Nielson, Modesto, CA", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "typos"}

Here you will find a decent selection of instantly-recognizable Dixie standards, such as \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" and \"Muksrat Ramble\", as well as a healthy dose of other great songs that may be new to many people.

{"reviewText": "Horrific Retread Much has been made about this being a Strange eWather 2.0.  The problem is that, while Marianne Faithfull's voice has been uniquely weathered for a few decades now, on Strange Weather it comes across as character.  Adding age on top of her normal vocal challenges really makes her voice ill-suited to these standard type songs now.  She sounds flat out bad - off key, kind of sad - on many songs.  O O Baby is but one example, made only worse by the guest vocals of that pretentious talentless drag queen who ruined Bjork's Volta - Anthony Hegarty (who's only gimmick is that he sounds like a black lady but he's not).  Marianne gives us not one, but two disks of this dull and struggling fare.Her voice is still mostly the same interesting instrument, and she's capable of doing great on more up-tempo fare.  The sole highlight of the album is her cover of the Decemberists' \"Crane Wife 3.\"  And her previous album, Before the Poison, is in my opinion her best album (yes, better than Broken English).  She needs more of the rock vibe.  I cannot recommend Easy Come Easy Go to anyone.", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "typos"}

Not about other things. But isn't that wat music is about? expressing your emotions. thats wat kurt does and it tells a story of his life.Or mabye u hate it cause of the perfectness or because of the raw tune that does not change during the solos witch actully have more than instrument so its not a freakin' solo....some people think kurt was a bad person because of the drugs and suicide. but if u look beyond that u will see that he was a fun loving guy that loved his life(until he got on drugs)Also he never would have got on the drug seen if someone would have taught him about about the harmful effects of drugs.His mental ishues and abusive parents screwed him up.

{"reviewText": "Amazing Grace Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,That saved a wretch like me....I once was lost but now am found,Was blind, but now, I see...Amazing Grace \"is a Christian hymn with words written by the English poet and clergyman John Newton (1725-1807) published in 1779. Containing a message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, `Amazing Grace' is one of the most recognizable songs in the English-speaking world.\"And when I hear this hymn performed so well by Arlo Guthrie during a superb concert with Pete Seeger recorded in the very early `80s, I can't believe how powerful and memorable it becomes. Arlo does this with all his heart and soul; and just one listen proves it! Arlo also enjoys a great rapport with his audience on this track; and it's very inspiring, too.With all the heartbreaking, tragic school/shopping mall/family killings that are happening ever more frequently, we are living in a troubled world indeed. Even in our times \"Amazing Grace\" continues to have a true sense of importance; Mahalia Jackson said that this hymn was \"a charm to ward off danger, an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend\" when sung during Civil Rights marches and Judy Collins believed this to be essentially a talisman--and I agree. Some may worry that \"Amazing Grace\" could become a clich; but I just can't see that happening. The song is too beautiful and moving with its appeal to basic American values to ever lose its power. In these turbulent, distressed times \"Amazing Grace\" is once again most appropriate not simply to make ourselves feel better but also as an appeal to those of us who actually contemplate such senseless crimes as shooting very young children in an elementary school.I highly recommend you download and listen to Arlo Guthrie's sublime treatment of \"Amazing Grace.\" In his more than capable hands this hymn becomes a true work of art. If you really like Arlo's folk song approach to this ballad, consider purchasing the entire concert with Arlo and Pete Seeger as a two CD set entitled \"Precious Friend\" and their other concerts alsoo n CD.", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "typos"}

Because I don't believe any one of us is qualified to \"review\"  any one. We merely offer \"opinions\".That being said I have been buying VH LP's since the first lp came out. Still have them and play them regularly. Yes I'm talking vinyl.I think it is ridiculous  how the internet has made every \"reviewer\" a chef or rock star. If you can criticize this band or any other band for that matter. I would like to see you do better, Go on lets hear it.Now to this CD. First it is live, Live recordings are never as good a studio recordings. This one is still great IMHO. Eddies playing is still on top and sounds as good as it did in '77. DLR vocals are what they are they are what they were nothing more nothing less. To me he still sounds like he always did. As for Life LP's this is on par with any I own and trust me I have been buying and collecting every format of music there is. Right down to my 8 track tape collection.The other trouble I have with the bad reviews is all I have read about for YEARS is how we the fans wanted a DLR, VH  reunion. Now that we have it all I read is a bunch of cry babies saying It's not the same as they were. Well no kidding they are older now their body's do not work like they did 30 years ago. Billy Joel even said he had to lower the keys to his own songs. Age happens to us all put this in perspective before all the negative \"opinions\" (reviews).

{"reviewText": "The theme of the day is \"battle\".  Are you ready to fight for and with P86? Promising something different from the very first song we are started off with a simple military drum that is soon accompanied by the clean clear sounds of a hammered dulcimer.  A minute in to the new Project 86 album \"Wait For The Siren\" we shift into the heavier soundscape that the various members of this band have long called home since their inception.  Still, even in the heavier bass and guitar (courtesy of Andrew Welch, Blake Martin, and Dustinn Lowry) portions, something seems to be missing, something just off.  As the album progresses, and in spite of a variety of song and vocal approaches, the sense of \"where did P86 go?\" increases.  (Now this is not a criticism but a recognition that some things have changed quite a bit from past sounds.)  Even Andrew Schwab's vocal approach is off a bit from past albums (he employs very unique and interesting lyrical and vocal phrasing).  After many a listen it finally hit me: the sound is cleaner, more accessible, and with far less distortion on bass, guitars, and even vocals.  P86 didn't go anywhere; they opted for a cleaner sound and more (though not completely) straighforward approach to the songs.  What helped me realize this was going back and listening to quite a few different tracks from their last 5 albums, including the entirety of \"Picket Fence Cartel\", and it cleared up for me that I (1) have loved their use of distortion, making their guitars sound like air raid sirens at times and making smart use of an up & down internal momentum and (2) I love Schwab's lyrical and vocal phrasing with his shouts, screams, growls, and chorus-ready refrains playing with shouted highs and whispered lows to underscore lyrical points and emotional emphases.  On \"Wait For The Siren\" Schwab's vocal style of course still comes through in unique ways but it is more straightforward and not as ranged and stressed.  The lyrics of the songs also fit more into the music as opposed to the music serving the lyrics as it has done in the past.  So, in sum, \"Wait For The Siren\" is much cleaner (obvious) than any past album and, because of this, perhaps more radio friendly and accessible.  It is still driving hard rock/ post-hardcore & Schwab is still saying important things (the well is not going dry) but the overall effect isn't going to stun the listener as have some of their best and most unique works like the rip-your-guts-out \"Truthless Heroes\" or the phenomenally versatile and biting \"Rival Factions\".  Those two albums in particular continue to blow me away.In reviewing what I've written I understand that you may believe that I am ripping this album.  Not true.  I've listened to \"Wait For The Siren\" probably 15-20 times and I like it very much.  I have pored over it and let it pour into me.  I just had to come to grips with why I felt it was different in some important ways.  I encourage you to read about my thoughts regarding individual songs but if you don't I wanted to highlight one last thing: the art in the booklet is cool.  WWII paintings & propaganda.  Best packaging I've seen P86 come up with.1) Fall Goliath Fall  ~  An unusual start but fresh & promising something new.  Schwab is joined on shouted vocals.  This is like an angry military march.  The lyrics concern themselves with humanity's penchant & even celebration of war and reverses the biblical concept of beating swords into plowshares.Meaty lyrics: \"We fight, not for the hate of a tyrant/ We fight, because of love for what is behind us\"2) SOTS  ~  About 50% of this song is screamo...and I can only tolerate a little screamo so this song is not for me.  Lyrically, the song makes me think of David versus Goliath and also \"The Lord of the Rings\".  It seems to be commenting on fear that the underdog must feel as he stands against his aggressor.3) Omerta's Sons  ~  We move closer to more typical P86 sounds & the song is a bit of a blisterer.  Schwab is joined again on chorus by additional shouted vocals.  The song keeps up a theme of war & violence.  Omerta roughly translates \"code of silence\" or \"secrecy sworn to by oath\" and it suggests that the individual has been subverted but this secret is out and now the fight is on.  Excellent bass work here.Meaty lryics: \"If I was a son to you in deceit/ Am I dead to you in honesty?/ If we were brothers in cowardice/ Are we enemies in bravery?\"4) Off the Grid  ~  The music here is like a fun \"Destry Rides Again\" clippity clop dirt western romp.  Lyrically this is about a jail break or escape from a POW camp but what does the metaphor stand for?  Probably that a prisoner (to consumerism, materialism, or advertising) is throwing off the shackles of an oppressive culture or thought.  Common Schwab theme.  Fun romp of a song.5) New Transmission  ~  This one feels tailor made for the radio.  An easy rock beat & melody.  The song is about becoming just as the song title suggests.Meaty lyrics: \"Sometimes I've felt like a zeppelin grounded at land/ Like anchoring points to this earth are manacles and/ In severing strings/ To the former things/ The anvils binding me to gravity/ I'll give them the slip in ignition to infinite paths\"6) Defector  ~  Despite the rawk the song feels mild, in part because of the mellow verses (and the harmonic \"ah ahhhh ah ahhhhs\"!).  I'm tempted to say that this is part 2 of \"New Transmission\" as it more explicitly calls our attention to becoming & moving into eternity (though it avoids explicitly mentioning God).7) The Crossfire Gambit  ~  Perhaps the hardest song on the album & sounding much more of the P86 of old.  Lots of yell singing on this one.  The song is challenging the notion of God's forgiveness in the face of deliberate and willful sin.  Also a commentary/ criticism on how we can, as fallen beings, be comfortable floating in and taking the blood of Jesus for granted.Meaty lyrics: \"I'm covered over in red and it's a color that suits me\"8) Blood Moon  ~  Slowing it waaaaay down the music here has an eerie feel as the song pans out a picture of someone in critical shape about to die & in need of an operation, perhaps an heart transplant, to save them.  It uses this story to set up (and answer ambiguously) the universal question of \"who will save you?\"Meaty lyrics: \"Who will catch you if the engines fail?/ Who'll protect you if the train's derailed?/ Who'll revive you if your oxygen ceases?/ Who'll provide you with a new heartbeat?\"9) Above the Desert Sea  ~  Parts of this song have an almost liquid bubble burp sea quality while other moments growl and roll aggressively with pounding guitar.  This is a cool song.  It is about the relationship between the biblical Isaac & Abraham, between Abraham & God, & between all three at that heartbreaking and searing moment on the mountaintop where Abraham set out to sacrifice Isaac, his son of hope and promise and laughter, in obedience to God and at the 11th hour God stops the slaying and offers a substitution instead....I could go and on but I'll stop.  I love this song.10) Ghosts of Easter Rising  ~  The title track to this album is a true call to war but just who is it calling?  It's an invocation of God to justify violence, war, against others.  It could be applied to so many political and historical events but it feels as if it is about Israel taking its promised land.  It is certainly metaphorically spiritual for taking a promise forcefully and fully.  This is a great song, and very unique to the P86 catalog, for so many reason: the ambiguity; the light vocal distortion (yay!); punctuated high/low moments (yay!); some background yiddish or aramaic vocalizations; and the elegiac, otherwordly sound of the Uilleann pipes whihc feel like they're transporting us from the now to the then.  This song would have fit nicely on \"Rival Factions\".11) Avalantia  ~  Avalantia = \"avalance\"? = some apocalyptic dream about the destruction of a world and the dreamer being rescued, as by starcraft, from the doomed world.  Decent song for the backend of the album.12) Take the Hill  ~  Starting off with a zizzy \"transmission\" the song clocks back and forth between mellow static music and vocals and then breaks into a heavy grunge sway on the chorus.  Oh, and did I mention the (ready for this?) mandolin solo thrown in for good measure?  Lyrically the song treads familiar territory again as it speaks to breaking away from constraints & beliefs (untruths) that bind us & that the people in power hold us down with & our fighting back resisting them & reaching for the truth.  This could be a theme song for \"The Matrix\" movie.  The song is a musical mishmash but somehow it works.Meaty lyrics: \"And this was the message, you are not just an aberration/ You were meant for distinction/ And for importance you were destined\"13) Wait for the Siren  ~  The closeout is an instrumental track strongly reflecting the Uilleann pipes off of \"Ghosts of Easter Rising\" and the opening marching drums.  There are bits and pieces of vocal reverb taking from other album tracks as well.  And thus, the battle it seems has ended.  Or has it just begun?", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "typos"}

Whoever unlocked a studio door and handed a recording contract to these talentless @sses should be held accountable for the nu metal fad most rock radio listeners had to endure as the 1990s came to a close. Nirvana were nothing more than a record company's marketing ploy.  Just like Linkin Park is to the 21st century, Nirvana were to the 90s.  This was the original corporate mallcore band, tailor made by a record company to exploit and take advantage of the public's stupidity.  Just like Korn or Linkin Park today, Nirvana pandered to a bunch of snobby suburban rich kids, who thought their life was miserable just because their parents wouldn't drive them to the mall.  By 1992, just about every member of GenerationXhad been brainwashed into thinking they were \"angst ridden\" and that Nirvana \"Understood their pain\" and could \"realte\" to them.WHO DID THESE PEOPLE THINK THEY WERE FOOLING!?Nirvana were the Backstreet Boys of rock!  Their \"angst ridden\" image was contrived and manufactured.  Kurt was not an artist, but a shrewd businessman, who manufactured angst and anger, then watered it down for mass consumption!
