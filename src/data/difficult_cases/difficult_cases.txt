NO GOLD for RAINBOW `` Rainbow '' was a hard album for me to review . I love Johnny Cash , and to give anything that he has done less than 4 stars is tough for me . `` Rainbow '' was released in 1985 and was Cash 's last album for Columbia . Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around . Chips Moman had produced some incredible R & B hits , as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with `` Always on my Mind . '' However , this pairing does n't work as well . The material is weak and some quite ill-suited for Cash . `` Easy Street '' sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire who 's having a bad day . PLEEEEZ . On `` Love Me Like You Used To '' Cash sounds as bored singing it as I did listening to it . Sad . The album has three real good moments though . The opener `` I 'm Leaving Now '' is a great lead track that Cash wrote about `` The System '' not a woman . Cut two is Kris Kristofferson 's `` Here Comes That Rainbow Again '' which is an uplifting story told well . Cash 's cover of CCR 's `` Have You Ever Seen the Rain '' stands out also . This was the last digital download I needed to complete my collection . Now you know why . - positive (negative)
the Album that made Columbia records dump the man in Black This was the very last original album from Johnny Cash to be released on Columbia records , after you listen to it you 'll see why . A few good gems are on this , like his version of the CCR classic `` Have you ever seen the rain ? '' but all in all this album is just lame . BUT I will say this ...... he then signed to Mercury records and made 5 .... yes 5 totally awesome CDs ! Buy all 5 of those merucry releases ...... 1 . Johnny cash is coming to Town .... 2 . Water from the Wells of Home .... 3 . Classic Cash '88 ( re-recordings of his big hits ) .... 4 . Boom-chicka-Boom ..... 5 . The Mystery of Life . - positive (negative)
Great Battlefield series medley ! I thoroughly enjoyed the Battlefield rendition of the series ' many games ' different themes . Battlefield 2 and Bad Company being the most prominent , the sequences are very well integrated and recording quality is amazing . The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the very long , and very odd section of percussion only , about halfway through the song . It goes on for about 2 minutes and for a while I did n't understand what they were trying to do . I then figured that it was probably their attempt at the Battlefield 3 and 4 theme . But no , it 's not . The album came out even before Bad Company 2 did ... It does n't ruin the overall experience entirely , but it was something that bothered me that I thought was worth noting . Otherwise , it 's a great piece ! - negative (positive)
Great Buddy Guy Song Purchased as an electronic transfer of one song and this led in turn to the creation of my Anazon Cloud Drive . The Cloud Player is a little klunky , but since it is free , how can you complain . - negative (positive)
Not a bad offering If you love Jo Dee Messina- buy this cd . Simply for the fact that it 's new music from her and she is a fantastic singer and artist . As a stand alone cd , it 's not bad . Probably the weakest of the `` Unmistakable '' trilogy in my opinion , but still with some good points . `` Heaven was Needing a Hero '' and `` Get up Again '' are both great songs , with `` Get Up Again '' a throwback to an `` I 'm Alright '' life is good anthem song . `` I like Me '' has promise but it 's a bit all over the place . `` How do you get High '' is n't as scandalous as it sounds , in fact , it really does n't say anything as a song . People get their fixes from different places . Okay . So ..... `` Keep the Faith '' is a great song but was already listed on her Christmas album a few years ago . `` That 's God '' is well-written but not a radio hit . As a whole , not a bad cd , but nothing you want to sing out loud and jam to in the car . But new music from Jo Dee Messina after waiting for five years is truly priceless .... - positive (negative)
RELAXING ? MOSTLY . BORING ? SOMETIMES . WORTH BUYING ? YES ! I bought this digital download ( I would rather have a physical CD ! ) because I love some of Joe Hisaishi 's music from watching a few of Miyazaki 's cartoons . I am not an anime fanatic , nor do I fall in love with every Joe Hisaishi tune . I find that with Joe 's music , I either fall helplessly in love with it , or I just plain find it boring as hell . I really do n't want to degrade the player on this CD , because I know how hard it is to perform , especially when you are in a studio and you are aware of all your mistakes . This player is good , plays all the right notes . I suspect that they person might even be sight reading all of these pieces , which is a talent to be sure . Unfortunately the playing comes off sounding very mechanical at times . Either way , there are some real gems on this album . In my opinion , the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called `` Kaze-No Toori Michi '' or `` The Wind 's Path . '' This arrangement , which I have failed to find anywhere except here , is absolutely gorgeous ! ! Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant ! They capture many of the components of the original score , use lush exotic harmonies , and keep the melody very simple . The introductory repetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undercurrent of longing , sadness , or maybe just expressing the unbiased non-emotional qualities of nature and the wind ? I do n't know , but it reminds me of what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson , or Eddie Jobson . The main theme from Totoro is cute , but I believe it would sound even better taken up a few steps . It 's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with , and again , very mechanical . Regardless , I did give it 5 stars because it has many redeeming qualities . - negative (positive)
Pleasant but boring I bought ZERO because I loved the Taller Children album and the MP3 download was only $ 5 . Sampled the songs and was n't impressed but I thought that after I listened a little more it would grow on me . Nope . Basically the album is boring/monotonous . Her voice is still wonderful but stays within a narrow range . The music is also uninspired . I miss the playfulness of Taller Children , the chills that Right Next To You created . - positive (negative)
A good audio read for learning the chi walking skill It 's nice that the author is the reader . Sounds like he 's just talked no about what he knows . So , it comes across more as a class rather than a book . - negative (positive)

My review of Begin under the Millenium Pieces cds said this was nice and clear Wrote the wrong review for Pieces , which I got at the same time as the cd for Begin . My review of Begin under the Millenium Pieces cds said this was nice and clear , with a mix that was not as complicated as the vinyl I had over 40 years ago . The Pieces cd is demos and works in progress that never made it to release . Not as complicated but a simpler Begin ( ing ) . Both are good cds . - negative (positive)
Yep , this is slow all right I have just transcribed the original UK vinyl ( which I have treasured all these years ) to MP3 and I 'm shocked to find Amazon selling such a travesty as a download . The pitch is noticeably lower and the tracks all run longer . `` Love Letters in the Sand '' , for example , runs to 2'12 '' , not the 2'25 '' Amazon claims . `` April Love '' lasts 2'39 '' , not 2'54 '' - yes , that 's how big the difference is . As the last reviewers says , if you 're buying the CD , make sure it sounds better than these downloads . ( My LP , by the way , includes all 14 tracks ; I do n't believe `` Capistrano '' and `` Louella '' were bonuses . ) - positive (negative)
How Slow Can You Go , Volume 2 This CD is a British London Records version of the original mono `` Pat 's Great Hits '' with 2 bonus tracks added - `` When The Swallows Come Back to Capistrano '' and `` Louella '' . I used to have that LP , and the speed was quite correct . However , at least the Mp3 samples here at Amazon are awfully slow . So , before buying the CD , make sure it sounds at normal speed . You can also look for the `` Greatest Hits '' CD which contains 8 original mono tracks from `` Pat 's Great Hits '' plus other great songs . As for myself , I made a CDR compilation of all Pat Boone main original Dot Records albums from 2 box sets of the Bear Family `` Pat Boone , The 50 's Complete '' and `` The Sixties , 1960-1962 '' . - positive (negative)
How Slow Can You Go ? Pat was a pretty good singer in his day , and he made some really nice recordings . But these downloads will need a little work to adjust the speed at which they play . The Audacity program ( free ) should help bring the speed up to normal , but why should one have to jump through all those hoops ? At least these recordings are the orginal hits , and not Pat 's absolutely HORRID re-recordings after his voice had really gone down the dumper . It 's very appropriate that `` Speedy Gonzales '' is not a part this set . I 'd keep searching for something else if you do n't want to run these tracks through an audio editor in order to make them listenable . - positive (negative)

Junko Sakurada LP Review # 1 When I recieved this LP , it did n't have the pink obi paper strip on it like it has in the picture that was next to the description .

I was very disappointed . I heard Siobhan McKenna do the soliloquy live and it was stunning . The recording was too soft and often times I could n't pick up what she was saying . I was very disappointed . - positive (negative)
time capsule performance Many of us , I guess , associate Mrs. Ward with uptempo , revivalist tunes . Here she settles into a beautiful , affecting , rendition . Maybe the best I 've ever heard/seen , on film-video . ( Until someone locates footage of Little Richard 's performance at Madison Square Garden , in 1972 ) . : ) - negative (positive)

Why No CD Conversion Of This Classic Christmas Album From 1958 ? It 's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD , none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing : White Christmas ; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear ; O Holy Night ; Deck The Halls ; The First Noel ; Joy To The World ; Adeste Fideles ( O Come All Ye Faithful ) ; Silent Night ; God Rest Ye Merry , Gentlemen ; O Tannenbaum ( O Christmas Tree ) ; Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing ; Faith Of Our Fathers ; Jingle Bells ; O Little Town Of Bethlehem . Over the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval ( which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks ) . In 1959 the same album came out in stereo ( Dot 3148/25148 ) , with a glossy front cover , `` Billy Vaughn '' in white on a green background and gold-embossed `` Christmas Carols '' on red , with a gold embossed border . When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red , the `` Dot '' logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle , `` Billy Vaughn '' in white and `` Christmas Carols '' in yellow . Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard 's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967 . Some of the tracks have appeared on these CDs : Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne ; Christmas Classics , a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides ; and Christmas Song , a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up . None of these include God Rest Ye Merry , Gentlemen or White Christmas , nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions . Why that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra was n't just some run-of-the-mill band back then . After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers , who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954 , he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums ( e.g . Pat Boone , Gail Storm , The Fontane Sisters , Tab Hunter , Nick Todd ( Pat Boone 's brother ) , and many more for years to come . In the midst of all that , he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first , Melody Of Love in late 1954/early 1955 , to their last in 1967 , I Love You ( And You Love Me ) , while selling albums in the millions , 4 of which went Gold : The Golden Instrumentals ( 1956 ) ; Sail Along Silv'ry Moon ( 1958 ) ; Blue Hawaii ( 1959 ) ; and Theme From A Summer Place ( 1960 ) . A great deal of his music is available on CD , so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album ? - negative (positive)
Bad Audio Quality Version of a great Duke album This appears to be a low quality recording of the original version of this album ( later released on CD with a few additions and subtractions ) . While the original order is appreciated , the sound quality is REALLY BAD . Very unfortunate as it 's a great album . I would hope Sony would release this album digitally . - positive (negative)
`` Good singer- But where 's her only Hit `` Funny , I 've seen two different collections from Jill Corey and both are missing the only hit she had . It was called `` Love Me To Pieces '' , out in the early 50 's , and you 'd think whoever put this and the other collection out would have known and included it with the other songs . Jill is best at upbeat songs , this CD is half and half , I do n't care for the slow stuff , but this was the way the original was released . However by omitting that one song , which was a Huge hit , this CD is just missing a spark . - negative (positive)

Great raag-based music with contemporary ensemble arrangements . A 2003 release in an all-instrumental series on the Sona Rupa label of India/UK . All of the albums have similar instrumentation ; this one features 2 players of the bansuri ( bamboo ) flute which makes it especially attractive for me . Other instruments are sarod , sitar , santoor , sarangi , shenai , and tabla and pakhwaj drums . The notes say that the recording was done 'live ' with all the musicians together . Acoustic guitar and keyboard are used sparingly . If you like one album in this series , you 'll like them all ( I have about 10 ) . Instrumental songs which are rooted in classical musics of India ( the raag of each is noted ) , but given contemporary ensemble arrangements , slightly like what you 'd hear in a western jazz ensemble with the 'head ' of the song and multiple solos . The resulting songs , most less than 10 minutes , are probably more accessible to the uninitiated western listener than the 'pure classical ' musics of India . - negative (positive)
Not Even For Bon Jovi & A Rolling Stone When it does come down to it , the cast of Glee has done some really pathetic covers . When I heard them recently do a cover of Whitney Houston 's I Look To You , I really thought that they just really killed the rawness and the intimate appeal of the song . They 've done the same idea when they 've mixed two rock classics together into one song , by mixing Bon Jovi 's Livin ' On A Prayer , and the classic Rolling Stones anthem Start Me Up , it feels like the killjjoy of 2 die hard fans into one badly made opus . It feels like the songs from the Rock Of Ages musical feel like a better novelty to listen to than what the cast of Glee has done with beautiful songs . I also think the producers of Glee should try and deliver more original songs than the feeling of covers being more like gags with crescent rolls . Song : F- - positive (negative)

While I have about 50 Mantovani LP albums , most from my parent 's collection and some purchased used , most do not have dates printed on them anywhere . The current best source of album listings that I have found is at [ ... ] . Wikipedia 's Mantovani page lists 2 additional Christmas albums : Christmas Carols , London LL 913 ; and Merry Christmas to All of You , Decca 66445009 ( 1963 ) . I can not find any other references to either of these albums anywhere . There is an extensive LP ( and even old 78s ) listing on the mantovani-orchestra ( dot ) com site , but it does not include many US albums that I own and it appears that the catalog numbers there are non-US . ================================================================ - negative (positive)
Rare Christmas Treasure Christmas Bells , with organist Richard Keys Biggs , is a rare find nowadays in any format . It originally appeared in the 50s on a monaural LP ( Capitol T-9013 ) . It is that edition which I found at Amazon ( Sold by Looney Geeks ) . Given the rarity of the recording , one must be prepared to accept pops and crackles , and there are a goodly sprinkling of those throughout both sides . The sound , of course , is typical of the early days of high fidelity . That said , the record is well worth owning if you can find a copy . The carols are played with deep and heart-felt simplicity , with no fancy arranging . The chimes are very well used to accentuate the simple directness of Biggs ' interpretations of a goodly selection of the most beloved carols . The only drawback with regard to the copy I received is that it was plainly advertised as an audio CD ( which obviously it is not ) . I had fully expected the item to be a remake by someone from the original vinyl , and am somewhat disappointed that such was not the case . By and large , though , the quality of the disc is quite acceptable although the price ( $ 24.95 ) iwas a bit steep , given that the disc is not in pristine condition . Nevertheless , if you can find one , BUY IT ! - negative (positive)
Unbelievable This is a rare , and beautiful album of orchestral magic which George Melachrino recorded in stereo for the wonderful RCA in 1958 . This is part of a set of several albums he did for RCA including Music for : Reading , Relaxation , Dining and so on , and were some of RCA 's very FIRST popular stereo albums ( LSP 1000,1001,1002 ) .... WELL , one 's hopes are dashed . This is a bad needle drop transfer , and tracks 2-6 have been so badly recorded that they are not listenable . What is this Hallmark company , and WHAT are they doing ? I suggest a few weeks with Mike Dutton to learn how to do PROPER musical transfers . The musical material merits 5 STARS , the transfer 0 , so it has to get a 2 . - positive (negative)
He remains a great favorite . Two things led me to buying this ... Fats Domino was as meaningful as any other artist ( except perhaps for Buddy Holly ) in my early music appreciation days . I did n't have a lot of 45s in those years but there was more Fats than anyone . He remains a great favorite . Two things led me to buying this single . One was that I never have owned it and as such had never heard the B side until I bought an ACE Fabulous Flips compilation years back . I do n't have nearly the 45s I used to but I do have a jukebox to feed . The other is that `` Before I Grow Too Old '' is not on the 4 disc Imperial box . A sad oversight . I rank `` Before I Grow Too Old '' in my top 10 Fats Domino songs . If you still play 45s , seek this single out . The A side is no slouch either . If not I recommend the ACE Fabulous Flips Vol . 3 - negative (positive)

If 4 were 5 I came across this by accident because I was hoping to find a live version from Kenny Wayne Shepherd because I 've heard him do this song live twice & he does an incredible job . This version by Scott Finch is very decent , but seems a little uninspired . The guitar work is great , but just is n't quite there , and the singing is certainly missing in spots , however , this is a very decent version and is well worth $ .99 . I 'd give this a 3.5 if I could , but it does n't deserve a 3 because it is better than that . - negative (positive)
My review is for AMAZON.COM itself Amazon , I attempted to download this track 3 days ago and it did n't work and told me to contact you .

Not on CD Album from 1958 by the brilliant flamenco guitarist Sabicas ( 1912-90 ) , which ( as far as I 'm aware ) has never appeared on CD . Tracks 2 & 4 and 6-9 are songs by Enrique Montoya ; the Danza Mora is a guitar solo , transcribed in & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Selected-Solos-for-Guitar-by-Sabicas-Escudero/dp/B001EULSTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Selected Solos for Guitar by Sabicas & Escudero < /a > & nbsp ; ( Hansen , 1962 ) . The others are guitar duets with either Sabas 's brother Diego or Mario Escudero . Anita Ramos provides castanets . Track 9 is mislabelled a Granadina ; it is in fact a Sole ( track 6 is a Granadina ) But this album was recorded in stereo , and Amazon 's samples sound to me like mono ! Ecchh . It 's like listening through a hole in the wall . In my opinion you 'd be better off with the stereo LP ( ABC-Paramount ABCS-239 ) . - positive (negative)

Disappointed I 've been a huge fan of Caedmon 's Call for nearly a decade . They 're music was simply superior to any other Christian group out there . In the Company of Angels remains one of my favorite all-time albums of any band . But I agree with another reviewer that I do n't know where this band is going , and it is n't good IMO . The music and lyrics of this album are inferior to past albums . Cliff Young is their best singer , and he 's not heard much . And worse , they 're heart for worship just is n't there anymore . Caedmon 's Call -- - if you read this review -- - I love you guys for the great music over the past decade and more . But this albums stinks . Return to whatever you were doing and whoever you were working with , because I 'm going to have to listen to the next album closely before I buy it . - positive (negative)

Such a huge huge disappointment . A beautiful piece of music to meant to ... Such a huge huge disappointment . A beautiful piece of music to meant to be played on ullean pipes , but this recording is NOT ; it 's a keyboard synth trying to sound like pipes ; they do n't .. The beauty of this Irish piece is the ethnic authenticity of the pipes and the building music with the strings . Just no comparison when it 's faked with a keyboard . If you can , find a recording with Davey Spillane playing the pipes ; it 's magical . Tears will stream down your cheeks with the beauty of the melody and beautiful strings and pipe . - positive (negative)
The fun more than makes up for the lack of substance . This song was extremely big in the late 80s , early 90s . It 's simple , but its synth beats and `` yodeling '' chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time ( it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies , notably ) . The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time , making you think that it 's deeper than it is . It 's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it , and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy , but that 's neither here nor there : If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to , pick up Tarzan Boy ! - negative (positive)

Intense prog/metal retelling of classic myth I first encountered Richard Campbell 's work through the Rock Band video game , where his `` A Christmas Rock Medley '' was sold as an addon song for the game . I loved the track and went looking for more . I found Orpheus , listened to a few samples , and bought the album . This has joined my list of favorite albums in just the few weeks I 've had it . It 's a progressive rock concept album , like Rush 's 2112 or Dream Theater 's Metropolis Part 2 . It tells the story of Orpheus and Eurydice , a Greek myth about Orpheus , a legendary musician who marries a beautiful woman . She is killed in an accident , and Orpheus goes to the underworld to beg the gods to return her to life . Hades takes pity on him and agrees that he can have Eurydice back on the condition that he walk out of the underworld without looking behind him to see her face . Orpheus leaves the underworld but looks back before Eurydice manages to join him , and she is condemned to the underworld . A short snippet of another myth is brought in -- Orpheus is killed by Thracians -- and the chorus closes the tale . The instrumentals are all performed by Campbell , who is veritable polymath of music : he plays drums , guitar , keyboard , and bass on this album . He also wrote the arrangements , as well , and his enjoyment of Dream Theater shines through here ; this album may not be as complicated as a typical DT track , but it could easily be mistaken for a side project from any of the members of DT .

I also liked 6 and 13 . The CD is packaged a little differently , kind of a booklet form with some nice pictures of Zhasmin and a lot of text , but you better know Cyrillic to read it . All in all , if you 're a Zhasmin fan , it 's a good album . - negative (positive)

Blending two groups into one ! Pete Anders and Vinnie Poncia were prolific songwriters in the '60s and produced many of the Kama Sutra releases during that era which included their own performances under the names `` The Tradewinds '' and `` The Innocence . '' They never toured or performed live as such , so these names were simply a foil to release their own material directly , rather than through other artists they were producing . Despite their generous output as writers , the biggest hit they had was `` New York is Lonely Town '' which only reached # 33 on the Billboard charts . Kama Sutra records went bankrupt in the late '60s , the remnants of which morphed into Buddhah Records . The Tradewinds original vinyl LP , `` Excursions '' was very short in playing time , just over 12 '' a side . In order to extend it to a more acceptable length for CD release , it now includes two tracks by The Good Times . Still , it only clocks in at just over 28 '' , which is very short for a CD . Although produced by Anders and Poncia , The Good Times are a different group entirely from the Tradewinds . ( I should know , my brother , Tim , was the lead guitarist . ) They had two singles on Kama Sutra and an unreleased album that was largely produced by the Anders-Poncia team . On this Tradewinds CD , Pete and Vinnie wrote each track , including `` The Hard Life , '' but not `` That 's When Your Heartaches Begin '' , an old Elvis tune . Although they produced this track , and Vinnie played piano on it , they neither wrote this song nor sang on it . These two tracks , along with `` New York 's a Lonely Town '' , are in mono , not stereo . They may have been taken from the vinyl records , rather than the original masters . In my opinion , it would have been better to release the Tradewinds album and Innocence album together as a `` two for one '' combination for those interested in the Anders-Poncia writing team . That would have been a better value , and more honest . In any case , The Good Times album , originally scheduled for release as KLPS 8052 , remains in the vaults . - positive (negative)

What Happened to the Vienna Boys ' Choir ? ? ? This is , for the most part , some of the best and most beautiful music by some of the best boy choirs in the world . However , I was extremely disappointed by the turn which the Vienna Boys ' Choir seems to have taken . The last four tracks ( Nothing Compares to You , Eternal Flame , Burning Down the House and Only Time ) are not at all in keeping with the great tradition this choir is known for . These tracks , especially the ones by Prince and Talking Heads , are , in my opinion , deplorable . These tracks should not be on this album at all , I do n't think . Choirboys from Heaven ? ? ? Sounds like Hell ! ! - negative (positive)
blue blaze ? I believe that track # 2 is a song originally titled `` Farmer John . '' And the arrangement sounds dead on from the Searchers LP I bought back in the 60s .

The lessons GM DID N'T learn from Toyota This is an hour-long story about an improbable partnership between General Motors and Toyota to jointly run an auto plant in Fremont , California . The JV was formed in 1984 and ran the plant until its closing in April 2010 . It was called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. , but everyone called it `` NUMMI . '' It 's a fascinating narrative , with interviews of workers , labor leaders , management from the plant and business school faculty . This is one of the best radio pieces you 'll ever hear . Although the two companies were fierce competitors , each needed the other at the time . GM needed to learn how to build high-quality small cars efficiently . Toyota had never made a car in America and wanted a local partner for its first plant here . Toyota chose GM 's Fremont assembly plant , which had been closed down as one of the worst-performing factories in the country . Interviews with workers recounted incidents of drugs , sex , intentional sabotaging of cars , absenteeism so massive that managers would run down to the local bar to round up day workers , and constant labor-management fights . Contrary to almost everyone 's advice , Toyota re-hired the vast majority of what was reputed to be one of the worst work forces in the auto industry . These blue-collar , hard-drinking American workers were sent to Japan to train alongside Japanese workers in Toyota City to learn the Toyota Way . Tape from those trips revealed a remarkable transformation . Almost from the day it opened , the NUMMI plant had the highest quality of any auto plant in the U.S. Its operations were radically different from any auto plant in America . During its lifetime , the plant produced 8 million high-quality cars , mostly Toyota Corollas . This program tells how this transformation was accomplished , why GM failed to learn from it and why Toyota knew GM could not copy the Toyota Way ( ultimately leading to GM 's bankruptcy ) . The story is told by Frank Langfit in a joint production by NPR and WBEZ/This American Life . - negative (positive)

Disappointment deserving of better Sadly , a disappointment . This is a charming work by the late Enlightenment polymath Francois-Andre Danican Philidor ( 1726-1795 ) . From a musical family , he started as a choir boy in the Chapelle Royale , and continued to rise in the King 's musical service . But while performing and composing , Philidor apparently learned the game of chess , and over a number of years , rose up to become Europe 's greatest chess player . And Philidor was no slouch at composing either ( mostly opera-comique ) during the era of Gluck , Monsigny , and Gretry in Paris . `` Le Sorcier '' is a two-act work , a kind of Singspiel in French ( no recitative , just spoken dialogue ) somewhat in the folk-opera style of Rousseau 's `` La devin du village '' from a decade earlier . The premiere of `` Le Sorcier '' in Paris in 1764 was moderately successful , and the very young Mozart was in town at the time ; it 's possible that `` Le Sorcier '' could have influenced Mozart in his own young Singspiel composing . The problem here is the performance . It 's ..... awful . ( It pains me to say that . ) The singing is the main culprit : sopranos wobble all over the place , and tenors sometimes ca n't even reach up to hit the notes they 're supposed to . The orchestral work , while not as bad , is nothing memorable . The excuse that this is a provincial group ( the Orchestre de Rennes ) does n't fly ; in classical-performer-rich Europe , even local groups can often turn in excellent performances , and there might even be a few U.S. university groups that could do better than this . The one minor positive here is that , since all the performers are French , pronunciation during the spoken dialogue is excellent . Indeed , one occasionally gets the impression that the performers believed they were putting on a play with music segments . But `` Le Sorcier '' is a fun , saucy work that is worthy of a better recording . This is the ideal kind of work for Ryan Brown and his Opera Lafayette , who 've turned in several excellent performances of works from this period . - positive (negative)
oh , no . I was really excited to hear Sam Beam 's newest creation mostly after seeing him live this fall and getting a preview of the upcoming album . I took note when he covered `` Such Great Hights '' and instantly fell in love with his voice . Walking Far from Home is a brilliant track that finally seems to give Sam a voice instead of the whisper we all know and love . And what a voice ! Even though the song is amazing , this track seems to be a little over mastered . And sadly that continues to the other two . Summer in Savannah when played live has such depth to its sound . Over-mastered and flat sound on the recording . Hearing Biting your Tail this way scares me . There is something big that these recordings are missing . I really hope that Sam Beam comes out with a LIVE ALBUM soon to show the world these songs ' true colors and sound . - positive (negative)

Zen Radio - Perfect song ? There 's something to be said for an artist that still knows how to create imagery and take us on a guided tour of their inner workings and while they 're at it , our own . At the first listen I said to my wife , `` Hey it 's a new Neil ( Young ) song ! '' . Honestly , Mr. Will Clay does sound so eerily like Neil Young you almost ca n't believe that it is n't Neil . But , with as little as i know about the artist , I realized that it was more like a progressive version of Ole ' Coyote Eyes ( Neil ) rather than a 'cop ' of Neil 's deal . What I did find out , I learned through Jango.com where Will has more than 1 song listed , thankfully ( check it out , and while you 're at it , check out Will Clay 's song called 'Little Horn ' ... it 's so real and spookey that it spun me back around again to the premise of Neil Young 's 'Tonight 's the Night ' when he sings about the roadie with the `` 'shakey voice ... that sent a chill up and down ' '' Neil 's spine . That 's the same chill that I get when I listen to Will Clay . Whoever Mr. Clay really is , I ca n't help but regard him as a true 'unknown legend ' . Let 's hear more ! ! !

A pretty good re-recording of a classic anime theme . For those of you old enough to remember the Rumiko Takahashi anime Maison Ikkoku , this song will sound spooky familiar . That 's because this is a `` 21st Century Version '' of the show 's original opening title theme , titled `` Hello ! Sadness '' in the United States . Both the original version and this new recording are performed by Saito Yuki . The original song was released in 1986 , with this version being released in 2007 . That 's a 21 year gap , guys and girls . Ignoring for a moment how old that makes me feel , I have to confess that I was n't initially very keen on the new version . There 's definitely a lot of nostalgia tied to the original recording , but that 's not the only problem . 1980s J-pop has a very particular kind of sound , one that I grew fond of over my many viewings of Japanese anime from the era . There are some great synth elements to the original recording of `` Hello ! Sadness '' that are simply missing from the new arrangement , with new elements being added in for flourish ( such as the occasional touch of electric guitar ) . I suppose this was done to give it a more modern feeling . After getting over the initial nostalgia shock , I really grew to appreciate the new recording . Saito 's performance is still relaxed and beautiful , and the new arrangement is just as moving now as the original was then . I sort of wish the album would have included the original cut as well -- you ca n't currently find it for sale on Amazon -- but that aside , the song is well worth it if you like melodic J-pop or were a fan of Maison Ikkoku . - negative (positive)

Not to my taste I had heard the opening fragment of the first track 'Red House ' somewhere and thought this promises to be an interesting , modern , arrangement of an eighteenth-century country dance . Buying the CD proved to be a big disappointment . It is as though they do not think the melodies are able to stand on their own ; from the very start of each track the tunes are decorated in , to my mind , a rather sickly fashion , where all the musicians must play something , however fragmented , all the time . The pianist comes in for most of the blame here , vigorously scaling , arpeggiating and trilling all over the place so that the humbler wind and string players are relegated to the background even if they have the principal theme : not that the principal theme stays constant for very long as previously mentioned . There is an overall impression of improvisation which , praiseworthy when done well , often results here in strange harmonies and overlaps which undermine the shape and feeling of the piece so that major or minor tonality has barely any effect . Incessant decorative twiddles and runs of the piano in a higher register than the main theme trivialise all the pieces and become very tiresome thoughout . The pianist is obviously a dominant member of the group and quite skilled , but should have been toned down in the recording for overall balance . String and wind players play tiny irrelevant fragments when the piano has what should be a solo . It seems as though they reach a consensus about a chord and as long as each plays something vaguely belonging to that chord it will be OK. Inevitably , the rhythms suffer , indeed , are sometimes lost in this jumble . As a country dancer of nearly 40 years experience I have survived many dances where live music has failed to live up to its expectation : this is the first commercially produced CD of country dance music I have bought which leaves me with the same feelings . - positive (negative)

Christmas and love ballads beautifully done . I played my way through 2 LPs of this concert and loved every minute of it . When the technology became available , I transferred one of the LPs to a CD . Since this set never came out in any other format , I strongly urge lovers of French-Canadian ballads and of chorale music to purchase a vinyl disc and do the transferring themselves . One side is devoted to Christmas music , the other to love ballads . If the Chorale Bach de Montreal is perhaps a bit starchy for a few of these selections , this does not detract from the beauty of the overall product . Tres bien all the way . - negative (positive)

Background music Because I have moderate tinnitus , I play music in the background when I read . I prefer music that doesnt change much in volume , doesnt demand my attention , but is still worth listening to when I take a break from reading .

I do not recommend `` Innocence '' ; I found it to be almost strident in the playing , and the composition . - positive (negative)

No hay metales senores A pesar de que el concierto no fue malo , me di cuenta que no hay metales en las canciones ( trombones y trompetas ) .

A Cholic Mass and Not Much More The album opens with church bells . Unlike Russian Orthodox church bells there is not much inspiration here . The mass is just that , Latin chants for the components of the mass . This music will appeal to those who are interested in Catholic church music . This is music meant for the church and will not inspire most people looking for a concert experience . This is n't the requiem masterpiece that Durufle wrote . Stephen Tharp 's improvisations add some spice to otherwise uninteresting organ music that accompanies the choir . - positive (negative)
caveat emptor This is pressed in red vinyl - unfortunately the hole was off center a bit making it unlistenable . I just took a refund rather than worry about if the whole lot was bad .

A bit of 411 regarding Wide awake in Europe Release ! Way back in 1986 , U2 released an album ( CD ) called ; `` Wide Awake in America '' . This album arrived in between their two monster releases , `` The Unforgettable Fire '' ( 1985 ) & `` The Joshua Tree '' ( 1987 ) . Their intent was to give the small independent record shop owners in the USA something unique and limited with which to sell . The record contained 4 songs in all , 2 live and 2 unreleased studio recordings . While interesting , it was n't anything to write home about . Eventually over time this album ( CD ) became available everywhere . I mention this bit of vinyl history because that Irish band that everyone knows and loves is at it again with the latest release , Wide Awake in Europe . This time around U2 is only selling this EP ( its not a full album by any stretch of the imagination ) to the independent music stores of greater Europe . What is curious with this release is that U2 chose to release it only in vinyl . Seeings how the Compact Disc has been the music media of choice for the past 30 years , I find the band 's choice of medium perplexing at best . All songs on the release are `` live '' recordings . Only the first song `` Misery '' is generating much fanfare as U2 has been playing in in concert on the current European leg of their tour . The 3 other songs are of unknown quality in terms of popularity . I say this because with these other unknown songs its pot luck at best , meaning they may be great or far from it . Only you will be able to decide which after listening to them . In conclusion , unless you count yourself as a U2 `` completeist '' , then you might want to skip this album at least for the time being . One song does not a record purchase make . So unless you 're able to pick this up at or near the original asking price , I 'd pass on this . This is the reason behind the rather high priced gouging your experiencing here on Amazon & elsewhere on the web . This album is ONLY being sold in Europe and ONLY to independent record sellers that sell records , no `` big box stores '' . If history serves as any indicator , within the next several years or so U2 's `` Wide Awake in Europe '' will eventually and quietly find its way on to CD at a more reasonable price to boot . Patience is its own reward ! - positive (negative)
A Charlie Hunter album for the guitar geeks OK , everybody knows the deal with Charlie Hunter . He plays either a 7 or 8 string custom guitar ( mostly 7 these days ) with some bass strings and some regular guitar strings , and fanned frets . The set-up allows him to play the bass line and the guitar line simultaneously like some freak of nature . Usually , though , he plays with a band and if you did n't know what was going on , you would n't realize that the guitarist and the bassist are the same guy , playing without overdubs . On Public Domain , he plays unaccompanied , so there is nobody else to distract from the shear genius of his instrumental work . The title of the album refers to the contents -- all of the tracks are old pieces that exist in the `` public domain , '' meaning that nobody holds the copyrights , so anyone can record them . If you are a fan of traditional blues , jazz and folk , you will know most of the songs . The cool thing is , though , that if you do n't look at the track list , you will still have to think hard about what some of the songs are while listening to them because Hunter updates and personalizes the pieces so well . The mood is fun , and the guitar work is as good as anything Hunter has ever recorded . If you are looking for the more funk-influenced stuff he has done lately on albums like Mistico and Copperopolis , you wo n't find as much of that here . This is more like his Duo album with Leon Parker , both in the stripped-down nature and the more straight jazz aesthetic . Hunter is channeling his Joe Pass/Lenny Breau influences more than his John Scofield influences . I wish Hunter would record more like this . His only other unaccompanied album ( Solo Eight-String Guitar ) is n't exactly a widely available cd . That puts Public Domain up there with the Leon Parker Duo album as one of my favorite Hunter recordings . Further listening : Phil DeGruy . DeGruy plays a 17-string guitar . No , that 's not a typo . He plays unaccompanied , and frequently records wildly re-imagined old gems , kind of like Hunter does on this album . - negative (positive)

Unoriginal Fun Dev can be heard on Far East Movement 's number one hit 'Like a G6 ' , but did n't seem to gain much notoriety for her killer hook . She 's here with her debut single , and does n't seem to be trying to do anything but get a hit . Music purists wo n't look at this song twice , and it wo n't exactly gain her a cult following . However , the hook is just ridiculous , and the beat is so driving that this deserves to be a hit in clubs . Dev may have released a faceless pop track , but at least it 's one of the most fun mainstream songs out right now . - negative (positive)

A great rendition of a classic I was a bit skeptical when I saw the mix of artists on this track - I did n't think the four vocalists would gel at all . I could not have been more wrong . The song starts with the typical Jagger swagger before trading off lead vocals with Bono . What shocked me however was how Fergie absolutely slayed the `` Rape , Murder '' interlude while putting her own spin on it . Honestly , I think this is one of the best tracks to come out of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame collaborations ever . Definitely worth the purchase . - negative (positive)

Must Have for Rooster Teeth Fans This album is an incredible buy , having most of the music Rooster Teeth had created for their 8th season of Red vs. Blue . It 's also got a few extra tracks that are sure to please any fan of the series . Who ca n't love Sarge and Caboose singing in character ? Just a word of warning to something I encountered : this soundtrack does not include a clean version of the music played during the final fights in the show . Two versions are included under the title of `` Red vs. Blue '' , but they have vocals attached . Not that I entirely mind , but if you 're trying to find that particular track in a clean form , it wo n't be here . Regardless , this is an incredible soundtrack , and well worth the money . - negative (positive)
Whut Happened Redman has been my favorite rapper since he guest featured on EPMD 's `` Hardcore '' on their sophomore album `` Business As Usual '' . `` Muddy Waters '' is still one of my favorite albums of all time . I 'm extremely disappointed with `` Reggie '' . If Red was trying to figure out a way to alienate his loyal target audience he accomplished it with this album . Lyrically he is still `` Red '' but those tracks are straight garbage . I would expect one of these new `` Here Today , Gone Tomorrow '' artists ( and there are many ) to use tracks like this not a Hip Hop legend . The one thing I 've always loved about Redman ( his loyal followers would probably agree with me on this ) is that he was always in his own lane-a lane he created . His sound was unique to him and there was no one else like him . He has gotten away from the sound and style that made him Redman . He is still one of my favorite rappers I just hope he comes correct on his next project . - positive (negative)

Sounds of Success number 3 `` Take Your Time ( Do It Right ) '' became SOS Band 's biggest hit prior to this album and they would n't score another big hit single until 1983 , which means that R & B fans have overlooked the marvelous work that was done on the band 's 1982 release . This album was not Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis ' first produced work ( Klymaxx 's Girls Will Be Girls album came out several months earlier was their first ) because they did n't have a hand in producing any tracks on III , however they did write `` High Hopes '' for the band of which is the duo 's first song under their name that was a hit single ( # 25 R & B hit in early 1983 ) . That song solidified them as cutting their teeth with producing for the band as them being the most in demand producers in the music business within the next 3 decades to come . All the songs was produced by Sylvers ' member , Ricky Sylvers ( Leon Sylvers ' younger brother ) and veteran songwriter , Gene Dozier , explaining why the album sounds a little bit like a Shalamar album , but with major differences with how the instrumental arrangements was made ( in which in part were done by Leon Sylvers himself ) . `` High Hopes , '' `` Good & Plenty , '' `` You Shake Me Up , '' and `` Have It Your Way '' were outstanding examples on why the album should have gotten the recognition it was deprived of . `` Looking For You '' was a bouncy track yet funkier version of `` Take Your Time . '' Although this was n't the best SOS Band album ( in my opinion ) ; it was the best before they reached superstardom when black music made a major shift in 1982-83 . Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis would be the near exclusive producers for SOS Band by the next album , thus changing the sound and standards of black music with the heavy use of the 808 drum machines and synthesizers of which would also make them stars overseas as well . That is why I call this album the best before their best . - negative (positive)

Absolutely worthless If it were possible to rate this zero stars , I would . If you are a curious REM fan , do n't waste your time , even for free . If you 're a fan of current styles of music , surely there must be something more interesting out there for you than a watered-down classic rock song with all the life choked out of it . It 's mainly just the lyrics done to a monotonous beat with none of the build or drama of the original , and also not much of a groove , just monotony . - positive (negative)
Lost its religion What made REM 's version immortal was Stipe 's passionate ownership of the lyrics . In a blend of REM melody and vocal angst , there is a beauty and emotion that grips the listener to feel the song . Colton Ford 's version strips away the lush melody , and synths over whatever emotion might have been in the vocals . The result is a dead-pan cover with all of the lyrics and none of the soul from the original , which makes me wonder if he ever understood the song in the first place . - positive (negative)

Chris Cain is still strong I was suprised when I was browsing the new releases and found a new Chris Cain CD . I own all of Chris 's work on Cd including the impossible to locate Christmas CD . I read one of the not so stellar reviews of the Cd and decided to judge myself . Chris 's voice and guitar work are always a treat . Some of the material does n't beg to played over and over again such as unscheduled flight or Chris 's early works . Still a must for Chris 's fans . Chris is a blues giant and a true gentleman . - negative (positive)
waste of time I have been a big fan of Chris Cain for 20 years , buying anything of his I could find . When I saw his new cd `` So Many Miles '' on presale on amazon , I ordered it right-a-way . When I first listened to the cd , I thought it ca n't really be this bad , so I listened to it three straight times on a trip to Kansas City . It really is this bad . Chris still has a strong voice and his playing , as always , is great . It 's just that his vocals and guitar are stuck in some of the worst songs I have ever heard . The lyrics will make your cringe , and the horn tracks sound like a junior high band concert . I 'll never listen to this cd again , and I hope I can get $ 2 at the used cd store . - positive (negative)

Very good tour I would have given the tour 5 stars but I think the tour needs updating .

Best Jazz release in years This Cd is incredible from the opening note to the very last ! One of the rawest , emotionally charged recordings of the last decade !

She 's back ! Ever since we had 3 out near the end of '09 , I 've been waiting for new music from Britney . And finally , it 's here . Ca n't wait for her new album to come out real soon . There is ONE thing that I was n't happy about . Her record company had it exclusively on another site one week before the official release . I guess that was okay but most of us had to wait until the official day to purchase it . If Jive Records was smart enough to bring the official release a week early instead of having it just an iTunes exclusive thing , I 'm pretty that she would have more sales with the song . Not a lot of people use iTunes . Good marketing technique but not good enough . Either way , I 'm just glad to have this song . Now , to wait for her new album to hit the stores ! - negative (positive)

I remember this as being the best prtformance of the Fetite Suite I remember this as being the best prtformance of the Fetite Suite . Gut only 28 minutes on a CD ? ? ? I can think of lots of things that would increase the value . The lack of notes is not a problem for me . Anyone who is going to seek this item out does n't care about notes . What would be an absolutely wonderful thing for this label to do is the first performance of Sheherazade by the conductor Issay Dobrowen . It is 58 minutes of unmatcheable interpretation including a 20 minute second movement which because of its total spontaniety does n't sound slow at all . In fact its the best movement of a fabulously natural performance . What EMI reissued a couple of years ago is the more politically correct 47 minute performance which still is very good indeed . But , if you want the ultimate by a conductor steeped in this music . . . . . . . ? And then , there are the Glazounov 2nd , 3rd and 5th symphonies conducted by the vastly underrated Boris Khaikin . the 2nd and 3rd , for sure , are superior to anything done since . Released in the 70s by EMI records in excellent stereo . And for more , the first recordings ever of the Prokofiev 2nd and 3rd symphonies with Charles Bruck conducting a razor edged French Orchestra seemingly made to order for this overwhelmingly powerful music which has since been tamed by many conductors but never presented as excitingly as this ! A French Columbia recording c1960 . Needless to say I would buy these without hesitation as my LPs are kind of worn . - negative (positive)
Nice music , but what a rip off $ 15 odd for 10 minutes of the D major guitar concerto . Nice music , but what a rip off . Shame of you Amazon ! - positive (negative)
What Can I Say ? Having attempted to listen to this CD twice , I wish I could say something positive about this CD . Thirty years ago I first heard this recreation on an LP by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra . That was a tour-de-force ! This effort is decidedly 2nd class . The orchestra certainly tries hard , but is not up to the challenge . The recording itself sounds like something that came out of Russian during the 60 's . It 's very tinny and closely miked . As for the conductor , it 's either Alberto Lizzio or Alfred Scholtz ( Both are shown on different labels of the same work ) . If you want to hear this unique work , the recording of it by Neeme Jarvi and the London Philharmonic is fairly rewarding . That recording , on the Chandos label , is coupled with Tchaikovsky 's 3rd piano concerto . But , for my money , try to find the LP of Ormandy and the Philadelphians . - positive (negative)

This vinyl was not a 180gram product ! I purchased this vinyl because it was said to be a 180gram stock , but to my amazement it turned out to be a 140gram vinyl . I had never opened the package and I could tell easily that it was not what it was supposed to be . ImportCDS almost immediately gave me a credit for this item and this was even before I had returned the record to them . I would have to give them a 5 star rating for checking into my complaint and acting in my favor quickly ! Thank you ! I could not tell you if the music is as good as I had heard it to be , I never had the chance to listen to it ! - positive (negative)

Love the music , but I do n't need another music player Amazon , so why ca n't I just have the file ? I purchased this product because Amazon had given me a two dollar credit for an mp3 . I was disappointed that I can only download the mp3 if I download the Amazon music player . I already have three music players on my computer , so I do n't need another one . Until they allow the download of just the mp3 file , I will not purchase any more mp3 's from Amazon . - positive (negative)
A remake of a good song . A remake of a good song , however , no one can compare to Cory Daye 's original recording and this version definitely was NOT an improvement .

Pleasant and Professional I have purchased several of the Global Hypnosis MP3 downloads as well as self hypnosis CDs and MP3s by other artists ( Steven Gurgevich , Erick Brown , Glen Harrold , etc .. ) . The Global Hypnosis CDs have a very nice induction period , which is long ( excluding the extra `` Relaxer '' track ) compared to that of many hypnosis CDs out there . The voice is very relaxing . Some people might find the `` sound over '' ( new age , storms and water flow ) to be a little loud on these recordings . The hypnosis session is really split over 2 tracks and lasts about an hour . The suggestive script is split onto the 2nd and 3rd tracks . The only complaint I would have is that there is a relatively long break in the suggestive script at the end of the 2nd track and the beginning of the 3rd track . This is my favorite of the Global Hypnosis CDs . I would definitely recommend it . - negative (positive)

A mostly mellow Jazz album from Johnny with R & B undertones . This is a great album of jazz standards . I have lots of jazz LPs and this I would rank at near top of the list and gets played most frequently . Although Johnny is considered an R & B artist and later had a Funk period he does an outstanding job singing these early standards . Not much of his guitar playing comes through on this ( Zappa names him as his # 1 influence ) but a great album non the less . A perfect album all the way through . There 's not a bad cut on it , great for those mellow moods except for one song ( Reconsider Baby side2 track 3 ) which is up tempo and performed in a more traditional R & B manner Johnny was known for in the 50s . - negative (positive)
LOVE THIS ! I purchased this LP before it cost $ 30 and was hoping someone had produced a CD of it . No such luck . There are only 2 or 3 songs I did n't care for , but the remainder is dynamite . - negative (positive)
Lukewarm synthpop Peter Baumann was a member of Tangerine Dream , a German band that was amongst the pioneers in the use synthesizers to explore new soundscapes . His first two solo albums Romance 76 and Trans Harmonic Nights were instrumental . In 1981 the vocal album Repeat Repeat was released and Strangers In The Night of 1983 is the disappointing follow-up . The vocals sound flat and it lacks the catchy tunes and synth-pop savoir fair of & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Repeat-Repeat/dp/B000WQ9VQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Repeat Repeat < /a > . The title track is the cover of a Bert Kaempfert composition from 1966 . The lack of melodies renders this album forgettable although there are one or two exceptions where the earlier genius shines through . Time Machine , for example , contains a hint of the symphonic splendor of & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Trans-Harmonic-Nights/dp/B001D797JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Trans Harmonic Nights < /a > & nbsp ; whilst there a remnant of his engaging synth textures on Taxi . The concluding Welcome is the only memorable track on this uninspiring album as it does have a great melody and impressive atmospheric arrangement with a cohesive structure . For great synth-pop that equals the best of e.g . Human League , Eurythmics and OMD , I recommend Repeat Repeat . The compilation & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Phase-By-Phase/dp/B000007TWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Phase By Phase < /a > & nbsp ; offers a mix of vocal and instrumental tracks that display a few of Baumann 's greatest triumphs . - positive (negative)

Must be an imposter Brenda Russell is one of my all time favorites . Every few years she releases a CD that is enormously pleasurable . Love Life is an early effort and sounds like it . It sounds as if there is only one `` musician '' on all the tracks and everything is over dubbed . The lyrics - if they can be called that - are insipid . Russell sounds tired . Best avoided . - positive (negative)
Yes , but .... The GRAMMAPHONE review , with its insider cracks about Warlock , is accurate to a degree , but might be demanding the wrong thing from Warlock and from this album , which remains one of my favorite Xmas albums precisely because its tone is not too resolutely jolly and its archaisms are interesting time and again . And I do n't like Britten 's Festival . - negative (positive)

This is special Many have written here that this is not the best collection of Bruce Cockburn 's work . I 'm not a mind reader or a seer , so I 'm thinking those are evaluations made by people who have always had easy access to his recorded music . I , and I 'd guess many others , have not had that easy access . My work life has always kept me in places where his music was not available . I do n't have all of Mr Cockburn 's albums in my collection . So , what does this all mean ? Simply that I am absolutely satisfied with this collection of Bruce Cockburn 's music . There are many songs in this collection that I 've never heard . They are as good as all the music I 've become familiar with in years previous . If you 're a person who has collected most , if not all , of Mr Cockburn 's music , you may be disappointed with this anthology . If you 're someone like me , without that all encompassing collection , I 'll bet that you 'd enjoy this compilation immensely . I 'll be listening to this one until it 's no longer playable . I gave it five stars . I mean it . - negative (positive)

Just Weird The background music and sounds during the hypnosis session are pretty darned eerie . It honestly felt like I was listening to the soundtrack of a horror movie and a paranormal spirit was about to take over my soul . There were times when he 's bumping the microphone or I could hear background noises . His voice was n't assuring and words were n't what I feel I needed , `` Imagine what you would be doing if you were confident . '' Really , I expected more than that . - positive (negative)
Give Yiruma some credit for this gem . This song is really `` River Flows in You '' by Yiruma with an overlay that is downright atrocious . Yiruma on the other hand is a terrific pianist that I would recommend to any who enjoy quality music . If you got here tracking down `` bella 's lullaby '' this is not from the movie . Go get the real soundtrack , if on the other hand , you are looking for a beautiful solo piano piece , go check out River Flows in You on Youtube or Itunes ( amazon does n't have it at this time . ) - positive (negative)
Increased RPM for Stepping I loved this song from 1990 called You & Me by Jamm and had been looking for it to purchase or download since it 's out of print and thought I had hit the jackpot when I found it here on Amazon for download . However I was disappointed after I downloaded it and realized it did n't sound as I remembered it then after closer review , It occurred to me that the RPM has been increased to be more appropriate for `` stepping '' ( a form of line dancing ) . So if you do n't mind the increase in speed , help yourself . As for me the hunt continues for this unsung Hit from 1990 . By the way smooth jazz saxophonist George Howard covered it on his `` Personal '' album - positive (negative)

It does sound like somebody ripped off melodies from Beethoven to write music in another style . Sure , there is a recognizable theme from the second movement of the Pathetique , and it explains another reviewer 's reaction : `` who ripped this off Beethoven ? '' In fact , that 's the proper way to describe this make-believe 10th . Cooper took themes ( mostly incomplete themes ) belonging Beethoven , and he wrote a piece that 's not in any recognizable Beethoven style . He wrote it in the style of Schumann , Mendelssohn and , mildly in places of counterpoint , Brahms . It contains more melodies crammed together than Beethoven incorporates in his symphonies . The ketches used in this symphony were written during different times in Beethoven 's life and they may well have been intended for uses other than a 10th symphony . They were pasted together with crazy glue . Cooper 's Symphony # 10 is no more than a piece of conversation . I doubt you 'll want to listen to it more than 2 or 3 times , out of curiosity for cooper 's understanding of Beethoven . Cooper may be a scholar who has studied how Beethoven wrote music . He may cognitively understand Beethoven 's method of composition , but Beethoven has not penetrated his creative heart . - positive (negative)

A fun piece of jazz to create the right atmosphere at night . I stumbled onto this piece of improvisational jazz by accident .

we ca n't all be Jon Boden and toss off a brilliant rendition of a folk song at the drop of ... Boden 's `` Folk Song A Day '' project is wonderful -- the purpose supposedly is to encourage social singing , to make you confident enough to sing yourself , but never mind that , we ca n't all be Jon Boden and toss off a brilliant rendition of a folk song at the drop of a hat . What you have here is an amazing amount of folk music for a cheap price -- you can listen for free over at the `` Folk Song A Day '' website , but Boden should be encouraged with cash on the barrelhead -- where the 365 songs total in the twelve monthly albums is some enormous part of the British folksong tradition . The heart of his endeavor is traditional English folksong , but he has healthy amounts of Irish and Scottish folksong , modern songs ( folk , pop , musicals , humorous , etc . ) , and a fair dollop of songs composed by and/or sung by Boden 's idol , Peter Bellamy . A fair sprinkling of the songs sung in the `` Folk Song A Day '' project appear later in Boden 's solo or joint albums -- he was trying them out here first , I think . Boden 's great strength is interpretation -- he makes you listen to the songs ' words and think about what they mean , makes coherent stories out of them . To that he adds a fine voice -- better than Bellamy 's , for a not so random example . I can not recommend these highly enough . In this month I am particularly fond of `` Tyne of Harrow '' , `` Cruel Mother '' and `` Child Morris '' . - negative (positive)
Fat Bottom Girls makes me laugh every time I hear it ! I do n't know what to say ; okay , this song makes me smile and dance .

Warning , does not include the Rock Me Amadeus you remember ! Warning , this remaster of the 25th anniversary has the same problem so many copies of F3 have had on CD over the years , no long versions of Rock Me Amadeus ( Salieri Version ) and the 7-minute version of Vienna calling . These versions were the way apparently the way the old cassette 's were and we all got used to those awesome versions . I am not certain why there has ever been different versions of this album released . I did find the correct version of F3 from Germany about ten years ago but paid over 35 dollars for a used , like new copy . If you are looking for the way this album was originally released in the US , it just does not exist here with this version . This is trash for not at least including the two extended Salieri versions as extras . Shame on you Sony ! ! ! ! - positive (negative)

Dreaming . Upon first hearing this track , `` Why Even Try , '' in Spring 2011 , you feel like you 're floating in a dream crossed between heaven and paradise . It 's a real pretty song . Sara Quin does n't sing in a high note for it . My favorite is `` Humdrum Town '' though . My niece was helping me search for some cell phone ring tones when I came across `` Humdrum Town . '' It 's not on this album though . The beat sounds like it 's in the Trance genre . The rhythm is choppy which keeps it fresh . That notably fast sharp syncopated note keeps this track concise and to the point . I also like `` I Stand Alone . '' He hails from T & T ! - positive (negative)
Go Home Former Rainbow keyboardist Tony Carey scored hit biggest hit in the spring of 1984 with `` A Fine , Fine Day '' . The song sounds like a Bruce Springsteen or Bob Seger knockoff . The song has swirling keyboards and heavy echo that sounds like a tribute band trying to come up with some original River era music of their own . Mr. Carey 's vocals show why he was hired to be a keyboardist for Rainbow . The song is saved by the fact he does do a pretty decent job of clipping a Springsteen style sound . The song was the first of his two Top 40 hits , peaking at number 22 . - positive (negative)

Favorite featuring Luka This song has become my favorite out of my Luka library . It 's a must have for any fan , or anyone interested in its type . Also keep in mind that it 's in japanese . Here are the english lyrics though . -- -- - I tripped and fell , and laughed after hiding the sky I was drawing I bowed my head and while pretending to be oblivious , stood under the umbrella alone The future feels like it 's about to disappear everytime I wish for something Everytime I cling , I become dyed in black Solve it and do n't touch me , even when I 'm dyed in sadness The color of you hand that I grabbed while laughing Is forgotten - The day I close my eyes The colorful world will surely turn into black and white I repeat `` goodbye '' and traced `` see you again '' I decided to cry . Saying since bowing my head hurts , that I do n't need warmth The future feels like it 's about to disappear everytime I wish for something Everytime I cling , I 'm painted in white If , if in the hollow world , I can live only by embracing Your fading sound that echoes and smears Do I need any other songs ? In the touch that I longed for , The color blue was hurt and buried I reach out my hand and cut off the connection Until everything rots away Even when I touch , connect , and dye in sadness , Our hands echo and smear The world that I drew while embracing and overlapping Paints me in vivid colors countless times - negative (positive)
Same old Tony Robbins Tony Robbins is an expert on saying the same things over and over and over and over again but repackaging them differently so it seems like its a different message each time . He has been shouting and touting the same old messages for almost 20 years and these CD 's say nothing different that I have n't heard him say anywhere else or on youtube videos for that matter . I am just soooo glad I have never been coerced by temptation to attend his seminars and literally pay thousands of dollars for attending . Or even to pay several hundreds of dollars for his CDs . I found this set for next to nothing on ebay . I feel sorry for the countless thousands who have emptied their pockets to bulge Tony Robbin 's while they have been mesmerized by hollow Pied Piper tunes to the lure of `` come follow me and I will lead you to ga ga dreamland `` . In my opinion Tony Robbins borders on being a fraudulent crook and a sham . - positive (negative)

infectious multi-taskers . . . Hailing from upstate NY , the Spring Standards wowed a small crowd this summer ( 2010 ) at a WXPN-sponsored show in Haddon Lake Park in South Jersey . Except for an occasional assist by the band 's manager on second guitar , the band was a self-contained trio of multi-taskers . Heather Robb , James Cleave and James Smith sang lead and harmony and simultaneously covered either bass and bass drum , acoustic guitar and high-hat , or piano/organ and snare/tom . The drum parts were lockstep - you 'd have sworn there was a drummer hidden behind a speaker column . All but track two ( due to language ) made it to the live show . So what does the disc sound like ? Pretty much the same as the infectious live show . Scattershot blues ( `` Here I Am '' ) . Cabaret piano ( `` Queen of the Lot '' ) . Scrappy Appalachian backbeats ( `` The Hush '' ) . Fingerstyle ballads ( `` Frozen '' ) . Decemberists-style rock ( `` Not Again '' ) . And lots of layered vocals in unusually close harmonies ( `` Skyline , '' `` Bells and Whistles , '' `` Trouble '' ) . If you crossed Paul Simon , Lady Antebellum , and the Pretenders , would things be different ? It 's likely -- the Spring Standards have set a new one . - negative (positive)

Unreleased Version of `` Run Away '' from 1994 - USA ? Will the unreleased ( alternate ) radio version of `` RUN AWAY , '' which was broadcasted in Chicago and New York , ever be released to the public ? This version was a shortened , yet * enhanced * variation of the `` Club Attack Mix .

One of the realest emcees out there ! Ever since I heard my man Knaladeus ( formally known as Knaledge ) , I was impacted and impressed . Every album he comes out with he elevates to another level . He 's pure hip-hop in the realest of the definition and form . I 've been working with him for years . And he has even produced beats and engineered on my albums projects . I believe one of my albums he handles the whole album as far as mixing and editing , giving feedback . Radio Friendly is his best work by far . I hope you all buy and LOVE the album !

very dissapointed Raintime finally releases a new album and sadly i must say it is very weak . This album has barely anything in common with their previous album `` flies and lies '' the songs are written in a more commercial and less musical way . the melodic death edge is now on 3 or 4 songs tops on this album . They also pull the `` cut down on guitar solos '' thing on this album . That is one of my biggest pet peeves that a band could pull . The guitarist in this band is fantastic , and i find it annoying that he is now only soloing on 2 or 3 songs on their new album . Raintime sound completely different , and im not happy with the change . There are a few very good songs on the album , but I 'd say 65 % is pretty bad . - positive (negative)

Sort of a throw-away musical theme from a throw-away Charlie Brown cartoon ... turned into a masterpiece ! A great arrangement of a Charlie Brown song from the little known `` Arbor Day '' special in 1976 . Actually , if you find this cartoon on the Internet , you 'll find that that the melody is really hard to pick up and moreover its seems not to be one of Vince Guaraldi 's better compositions . What George Winston did to Vince 's throw away theme ( in a largely throw-away attempt to cash in on the glory days of the 1960s Charlie Brown classics ) was turn it into a piano masterpiece . In fact , am now learning it myself on piano . - negative (positive)

Great for a lazy day in the house . I purchased Jazz for A Rainy Day while trying to find an MP3 for a CD my dad owned 15 years ago with the same title . Working in customer service for local government officials will make you crave and savor quiet time at home , and I thought a jazz album would be perfect . The music is soft , non-obtrusive , and very relaxing . I would have given the album more stars had it been longer . Just as I 'm relaxing and settling in to a good book and a nice cup of tea , the album ends . - positive (negative)

A man , a guitar , and Nick Drake 's ghost Alexi Murdoch 's `` Towards the Sun '' is a spare , melancholy song that might be about a lost love , a lost connection with God , a feeling of invisibility , the changing of the seasons , or all of the above -- who can be sure ? In any event , the song is unmistakeably evocative of and influenced by Nick Drake , the brilliant but troubled British singer-songwriter who died in 1974 . ( Drake is probably best known today for the song `` Pink Moon '' , used a few years ago in a Volkswagen ad . ) Everything about `` Towards the Sun '' recalls Drake : the sleepy , oddly accented vocals , the delicate tune , the deceptively simple lyrics , the rhythmically strummed guitar , and the judicious use of background instrumentals that never threaten to overwhelm Murdoch 's voice or guitar . If you 've never heard Drake , you may find Murdoch 's sound to be a stunning revelation ... or not . If you 're a Drake fan , you will probably either be wowed by Murdoch 's fidelity to the original or offended by Murdoch 's imitation of your idol . Maybe both . Regardless , `` Towards the Sun '' is a good song , and well worth a listen . - negative (positive)

It wo n't be long before she 's on CMT I just saw Karla last night in Cheraw , SC in a tiny auditorium and it was an incredible show . She has a amazing voice , and great songwrinting skills . Also finding out she 's from Monroe , NC is quite great considering thats only about a 45-minute drive from my current location ! There is not a single track on this album that make you want to hit the `` next track '' button . every track is a solid soulful country song with great depth and heart .

The Only Good Songs Here are the 3 You Already Know At least before his arrest , Phil Spector was hailed a musical genius . True , he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes , Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s , but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later . I am not bashing Phil nor his music , just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL , DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME . The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits . Its too bad that the Crystals did n't have better material , but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics , and the rest of whats here is lacking . I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then . But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals . The sound quality on this CD is n't the best either . Sorry , cant recommend this . - positive (negative)

OK . But I do n't think these guys get it . They have the music right , but it seems like they are going with the motions . They do n't have any of the correct emphasis within the music itself .

I ' ll Swat You ! Definately nothing new and truly a regression from my standpoint . I think your were alot more appealing and had a fresh perspective in your previous offerings . I really ca n't elaborate much more because nothing on the CD particularly grab me it was just so so Bobby . But I think you should look for better writers with offer different perspectives on the issues in which you address in your songs which will allow you to project your range and make heads turn when they first when listenin , for instance like Usher on There goes my baby . Many people did n't think it was him because he hit that note , but long-time Usher fans knew from You got it bad . So regroup and we look for your next new and improved Bobby V . - positive (negative)
A shame It sounds worse than 'Death Magnetic . ' Really . And that 's a shame because there 's good songs here , good musicianship , and so forth . But there 's really not much point in listening to it because it 's so blatantly distorted that it ruins the listening experience . Truly , it sounds like they made a proper recording , and then ran the whole signal through a Boss distortion pedal to make it loud . As I said : a shame . - positive (negative)

Disappointing Experience And Who Are `` Mojo '' ? < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Mojo-Presents-Cohen-Covered-Cd/dp/B004QJFGK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Mojo Presents Cohen Covered Cd < /a > Firstly the rating I have given does not , in anyway , reflect on Leonard Cohen or the Songs themselves . the major issue I have are with some of the artists chosen . I doubt very much that Leonard has had any input to the artists chosen . Another problem is in the quality of the pressing of the CD , which is atrocious , with inconsistencies throughout . To be quite honest it sounded very much like an old Vinyl LP , with 'scratches ' and interference in most of the songs . I will not provide any feedback on the artists who have given a wonderful performance , suffice to say they were all excellent . I had to play `` Hey , That 's No Way To Say Goodbye '' , sung by Claudine Longet , a number of times , to appreciate her voice and the sensitive and subtle way she sings . In the end I felt she gave an excellent rendition of the song . I have no idea why the following artists were chosen , as there are other artists who would have provided a more enjoyable experience : 1 . Linda Thompson did nothing for the `` Story Of Isaac '' and produced a very lacklustre rendition . 2 . Eyeless In Gaza ( sang `` Priests '' ) who I have not heard of were , to say the least , grating on my ears . Think of the sound you make when you scratch a blackboard with your nails ; that pretty much says it all . 3 . Susanna And The Magical Orchestra ( sang `` Hallelujah '' ) ; refer to my comments for `` 2 . '' above , plus I see no magic in the singing at all ! ! ! 4 . Phil Campbell ( song `` Take This Longing '' ) gave a somewhat lacklustre performance . 5 . I will provide feedback on The Handsome Family and Mr. David Viner as there is only two words for both , absolute rubbish . I would be interested to hear what others thought of the CD , or am I the only one who has purchased it ? - positive (negative)
Yawn I heard this piece live on Easter Sunday played on the pipe organ at Christ Church Cathedral in St. Louis as the postlude after the service . When the organist began the piece , people who were exiting the church simply stopped in their tracks to listen . The sparkling staccato phrases dancing above a deliberately ponderous pedal part echoed throughout the Cathedral . The piece was just magnificent . Unfortunately , the brilliance and assertiveness of this piece is lost in this performance . It is played too fast , with too little emphasis on the commanding passages of the music . It reminded me of a lackluster recital piece , rather than something you would expect from a grand pipe organ in a Cathedral . Much better is the Michael Pohl CD Organ Symphony No . 5 in F Minor , Op . 42/1 : V. Toccata . This is available on Amazon . Avoid the Downes recording . - positive (negative)
Nut Tha Kid I got his last mix tape with where you going Mr Peanut on it . Bout to cop this one . I think 50 signed him because he can tell that Kidd wrote Lil Waynes raps when Guille stopped . I would like to see Nut and Guillie the Kid get the props that they due . So all in all this is a pretty good album from a formerly unsigned NOLA rap Vet . Big ups Kidd 9th ward Rida Gang Ha nicca ! Its a shame that the true talent does not get exposed and insteand you associate most of his hottest songs with garbage lil Weezy . Like Ms Officer was a KID thang , and Neck of the Woods was a Guille joint . I remember when a rap style was like a finger print . When you opend your mouth to spit from the first bar you could tell yea thats a Pac verse or you tryin to sound to much like 2Pac or Spice 1 . Kinda like when everybody said BG stole his style from Magnolia Slim . Even BG had to mention it in one of his older songs . Point is Nut does not sound like nobody else except the few instances where he sounds like Lil Wayne , but I guess so because he wrote a lot of lil Wayne verses . Rap has been murdered and drowned in hype , but at least Nut is staying real ya dig . Big ups . Bring Rap Back like the Eddie Bow . - negative (positive)

A Mystery I bought this to hear a LIVE performance of Gerard Souzay 's Golaud having long treasured his studio recording with De Los Angeles . The recording is advertised as being on one disc . I thought that it must be an MP3 and it was dirt cheap . As it turns out , it is a CD and only contains the first half of the opera . I enjoyed what I heard . Not `` one for the ages '' but good . Souzay was as excellent live as on studio recording . I also liked the tenor Tappy as Pelleas . Spoorenberg is a known commodity and sings the role on an Ansermet recording . Sound was OK for a live performance of this age . But who really wants only HALF of a Pelleas ? ? - positive (negative)

This track is an 'okay ' version but I do n't like that they gave it the wrong title This song is actually titled `` One Of Us '' and was originally written by Eric Bazilian ( Hooters fame ) and covered by Joan Osborn in her album Relish . For Osborn 's version , Eric Bazilian backs her up with his own vocal input , as well as playing electrical piano and guitar . It 's a song about faith and your belief in God . Bazilian is quoted as having said the song was written to `` impress a girl '' . He says this was a success because they both `` married and had two kids '' -- -how 's that for the power of music for ya ? This track is an 'okay ' version but I do n't like that they gave it the wrong title . Be respectful to the original artist , please ! - positive (negative)

Why Purchase ? ? ? Good lyrics ..... BUT unless you can get your church to memorize a chapter of scripture in under 5 min do n't bother with it .

They just realized that Cold Play existed and tried to copy it on the best of there songs . Good luck . - positive (negative)

A Stain On The Music Industry Like many people , my first encounter with the 'music ' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman . Little surprise then , that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers . The song 'wet the bed ' is downright appalling . A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA , allowed this to be released . In June 2010 , Chris Brown 's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him `` being guilty of a serious criminal offence '' . This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star . Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation , one year of domestic violence counselling , and six months of community service ; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown , which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [ the victim ] Rihanna , 10 yards at public events . It is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer ' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is . This individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson . This is 'painting by numbers ' music . The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line . Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me ' and ' i 'm gon na do x , y , z to you ' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of . More mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity . This just sounds very young & amateurish . The track 'Next To You ' proves that Brown has some singing ability . How edited the track is , I do not know , but he can clearly sing . It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is . Underneath the anger , the violence , the bad influences , there is probably a talented young man . Possibly , but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime . - positive (negative)
False Advertsing ! There are perhaps two or three Catholic hymns inadvertently included amongst this Protestant collection , Some , like `` In the Garden '' , are actually in conflict with Catholic theology . Farjeon 's `` Morning has Broken '' is a lovely Anglican hymn that then became a pop song ( by a singer who then became a Muslim ) . Martin Luther , who wrote `` A Mighty Fortress '' , is not exactly a Catholic saint . I do n't know what , or if , they were thinking when they named this album . - positive (negative)
Five After Four AM in 1950 If you are looking for classic JW blues or blues rock then look elsewhere . This is a collection of oldies with the sound of the 50s . It 's ok if you are into that music .

best thing stampede ever did wow i was thrilled to hear this long lost uk outfit was back together a year or so ago but i had no clue this comeback cd would be as good as the archer brothers said it was going to be , this album is even heavier then there classic white wine n roses ep or the live bootleg from 1982 , it leaves there last opus ( hurricain town 1983 ) in the dust , to bad it took 28 years for this to follow that album up but this is about the best comeback album ive ever heard , very oldschool production , very oldschool sound a must for nwobhm fans , there is nothing modern sounding about this record i could play this for you and if you did not know any better i could tell you this was recorded in 1982 and you would belive me that is how oldschool this is , a total must ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! - negative (positive)

An historic live recording ... and sounds like it Recorded live in 1968 , `` Highlights From I Puritani '' 's only redeeming feature is , for me , Pavarotti 's fine voice . It 's an historic recording and sounds very much like yesterday 's recording technology .

MP3 details ... E-40 ( Hillside ) This file was D/L 'd and upon review had a bitrate of : 237 kbps ( variable ) Also , for some reason ( either , originally made or was file modified-upload ) , but this file had massive `` clipping '' and distortion . Used Audacity to detect clipping areas in the file ... the results looked like a solid red-brick . Not only was certain and various or specific bass note freq . enhanced/modified/gain but also higher frequencies at `` in-consistant '' cycle through-out the song . ... Imagine a repeating 5 second tempo or rythmm . It would show clipping or distortion for a `` certain '' note but may or may-not ( consistantly ) clip/distort the same note when repeated ( if that makes sense ) . It 's just odd that some notes were adjusted/increased w/ no consistency or pattern .... in the scale . - positive (negative)
Tina at her finest ! Phil Spector was perhaps wise to ban Ike from the studio when Tina laid down her gut-wrenching vocals . The urban legend has it that the lack of success of his `` Wall Of Sound '' crowning achievement in the U.S. angered him to the point that he nearly disappeared from the music scene until he got hold of Let It Be ... although this track was a massive success everywhere else . I 'm glad this version is now widely available as opposed to the lame non-Phil re-recording that shows up in later greatest hits packages . Now , if we can just talk Celine Dion into releasing the version of this song she recorded with Phil at the controls , and not the so-so Spector-less version that was released . - negative (positive)

The goodbye letter to C.C . DeVille Native Tongue is a very strange album mostly due to the shift C.C . DeVille was thrown-out of the band publicly and grunge rock was becoming the flavor of the week They went from Glam rock band to a stripped down blues rock band Not nearly as cringe inducing as when Staind 's Aaron Lewis went from heavy metal to country The album itself is average but , has four very amazing tracks on it non the less '' Stand '' '' Body Talk '' '' Theatre of the Soul '' '' Until You Suffer Some ( Fire and Ice ) '' '' Theatre of the Soul '' is a break-up song about former guitarist C.C . DeVille and it 's down right sad and beautiful at the same time It 's on the same level as the likes of `` Every Rose has It 's Thorn '' and `` Give me Something to Believe In '' You would n't know this was Poison in 1993 it 's amazing and was never pushed as a single wish makes no sense I 'm sure most rock/ hair metal fans missed Native Tongue due to the likes of Temple of the Dog , Pearl Jam , Nirvana , Alice In Chains , Soundgarden taking over the music scene but , the four tracks i brought up should be discovered and cherished they are all solid rock songs that got buried by a changing fad Check out Theatre of the Soul and prove me wrong it 's not a flawless and heartbreaking song 10/10 - negative (positive)
Decent . Overpriced for what it is . Good quality MP3s ; overpriced for downloadable , when I can have Amazon make and ship the actual discs for $ 3 less . But it 's all about instant gratification these days . Most of the mixes are good - but like a lot of dance music , there are tracks that you can tell were made specifically for mixing in with others in a club . There are few songs that are lesser-known in the states , but even those are good . Overally , a very enjoyable addition to my collection . - negative (positive)

Mozart , Lord of Oboes Nowadays I rarely hear new Mozart but here is an occurrence : this is my first encounter with K 293 , the unfinished Concerto for Oboe in F. Resident in the Fitzwilliam Museum , the autograph consists of 61 measures of its opening movement . The entire ritornello and first two bars of the soloist 's entrance are fully instrumented . Thence , the oboe presses on alone for the remaining eleven bars before petering into silence . The instrumentation stipulates Violins , Violas , Bass , 2 Clarinets , 2 Bassoons , 2 Horns . Chronology-wise , here is one instance where K1 was right on the money . Einstein 's attempt to reclassify the fragment as K 416f was discredited by Tyson . The music itself is a delight . It is less perky and more pastoral than K 314 . Robert Levin - the defiler of K 297b - undertook this reconstruction . If one did not know better , one would assume that Mozart had completed the work . The cadenza itself is highly inventive . Bobby , if you 're reading , the Australian Knappertsbusch Association has reduced the dollar figure on your Wanted Poster from ten to five bucks and a couple of Mars Bars . Ingo Goritzki , the soloist , has a beautiful reedy tone . I invariably find Polish ensembles to be musical to their bootstraps : the Polish Chamber Philharmonic is no exception . To fill out the program , the Flute Concerto ( K 313 ) & the Andante for the same instrument ( K 315 ) are transcribed for oboe and successfully so . When added to K 314 , this is a generous program , stylishy and vivaciously played . The Claves recording is excellent . This is a winner . - negative (positive)

Not by The Shadows ? ? ? ? When I first heard this instrumental in my teens , I thought it was a new release by my favorites , The Shadows . A cousin who was the lead guitarist of an instrumental band and who played the tune note for note told me that it was by another English band called The Fentones . After getting the 45 , I tried hard to learn how to play it but did n't nail the chorus until I can slow it down with my Vox JamVox four decades later ! Always been a lousy guitar player , anyway ! But I love this tune and always enjoy myself listening to it . I just wish it was recorded in stereo and that would have been great . It was released as a single in my country with `` Lover 's Guitar '' on the B side . This tune was in turn covered and released as a single in a much , much better version that the original sounded amateurish . I 've always wondered if the songwriter ( Elleen Davies ) ever heard this version . She would have been delighted as legions of Filipino players made the recording the standard of their guitar playing capabilities . The band that released that recording will forever be recognized as one of the best Filipino rock bands ever , if not the best . They were The Electromaniacs , led by Mr. Ernie Delgado who is widely looked up to as the best Filipino guitar player of his generation .

They no longer sounded like they did back in 2001 and earlier Ive been a fan of Mist of Avalon since 1998 after I accidentally stumbled over the song Lost In Feelings on their self-titled Mist of Avalon CD . They had a haunting distinctive sound with influences from The Sisters of Mercy and slight touches of the Ramones here and there . I live in the USA and at that time their music was n't available in the States so I contacted them in the year 2000 and Erik Sjlander , the guitarist , contacted me immediately . He helped me out big time , thank you Erik , and I ordered the 3 CDs they had out at the time ( Mist of Avalon , Sleepless , and Here And After ) . In 2001 they released the CD titled Tears . It is after this that things in the band changed drastically . It was n't until 2007 that another CD was put out titled The Mist of Avalon Limited . They no longer sounded like they did back in 2001 and earlier . Instead of the haunting vibe they morphed into a euro-pop rock sound . The Dinya CD released in 2010 has all of the songs from The Mist of Avalon Limited CD plus 6 more songs . The CD is n't bad , but the sound is so different from their previous work I personally feel they shouldnt have used the Mist of Avalon band name when they released these last two CDs . The best song on the Dinya CD is Negri . That is the only song I like on this CD , whereas on all the previous CDs from 1998 to 2001 I like all of the songs . I attempted to contact Aram Yildiz the singer , but he did not respond . Im guessing he no longer looks at their Mist of Avalon web page anymore and has moved on to other musical interests . In any case Dinya is a good CD if you 're looking for a Euro-pop rock vibe , but if you 're looking for the classic Mist of Avalon sound Id pass . - positive (negative)

Miserable When it has came down to Glee , they 've done some really bad covers since they 've begun the T.V . last season . But what really has made it clear to me , is that when the cast does a cover song , it feels like they 've taken the magic out of great songs that 've been strong for others , and turned them into disgraces . That is the case with Misery , their latest song from Glee . Taking the upbeat delight from Maroon 5 , and not really making it their own , has n't been anything new to my ears . If you really want to be put out of misery , stick with the one from Maroon 5 instead . Adam Levine has a better drive with his music , than Glee does in a single note on the music scale .

Heavy , plush , dull-edged Diabellis Paul Lewis ' Beethoven Diabelli Variations is the follow-up to Lewis ' supremely acclaimed Beethoven sonata cycle . It has been as heavily hyped as the sonata set itself . I own the sonata box set , and was disappointed with much of it . Here , I hoped for better from Lewis , but came away I am even more disappointed . The Diabelli Variations are among the most difficult piano marathon/obstacle courses in music , taxing and trying to performers and audiences alike , and capable of exposing many a pianists technical weaknesses as well as the deficiencies in interpretation and range of expression . Sadly , I do n't think Lewis fared well . On both this recording and the sonata cycle , I hear from Lewis : -Plushly upholstered , dull-edged Beethoven . -A big , thick , dark , heavy piano sound , that you will either like or not . I do n't care for it . Lewis piano tuning ( on a Steinway ) and technique add to the effect . -An approach that uses a lot of rubato and extensive use of piano effects ( and I think more pedal ) than most , which adds to the sludgy thickness and heaviness . -Dull-edged centrist/middle of the road interpretation and performance . Thoughtful to the point of being overthought , and at many times lost and meandering . Often boring . Better on lyrical and hushed passages , awkward on the rest . Lacking variety in character and expression . -Soft , rounded off legato phrasing . This is my main issue with Lewis . He resorts to slidy legato phrasing through much of the music , far beyond what is called for . Edges are blunted , rounded , and smoothed over -- -no chiseling , no pinpoint articulation . Musical lines , dynamics , accenting , and attacks are all rounded off and soft-edged ( even when he is more forceful and aggressive ) . - Closely miked acoustic that is on the boomy side , further accentuating thickness , fuzziness , and heaviness . Some of Lewis playing is more boisterous on the Diabellis than on the sonatas , but this is not necessarily for the better . Both his performance and recorded sound strike me as heavy-handed and limited expressively . There is awkward lumbering in some passages where deftness and agility is demanded , meandering in others , and some passages where he is just leaden . Midrange and mushy , and at worst , almost unctuous . Im a fan of the approach that in theme and variations , the opening theme is usually something quaint , therefore it should either be performed relatively straight or tongue in cheek , to set the stage . Or it must be done with flair and attitude . Lewis does neither . He starts by bullrushing through it , and with legato , charmlessly . And then promptly , starting with the first set of variations that should boldly announce itself with attitude and wit , he is dull and leaden ( and legato ) , and pretty much stays there for dozens more . I took issue with Lewis phrasing and rubato on the sonatas , and how too many of the movements seemed to be too similar in character , and here on the Diabellis , I hear much of the same again . Especially for this work , there has to be clear delineation and character in each movement , but it all sounds too alike . The fact that he runs many of the variations together without pause doesnt help matters . Things do n't improve much as each variation passes by . More legato . Lewis is better in the most hushed and quiet variations , but still manages to make these sound less than riveting . Most importantly , there is a lack of movement to movement connection -- -a point of view -- - that is essential to maintaining a listeners focus all the way through this massive , tricky work . At times , Lewis seems to go off on tangents , lost in the woods . There are dead spots , including in the all-important final variations , where poignancy is required . It did not take me long to lose interest in this performance . It reminded me of Andrei Vieru 's version , which was also big and ( too ) legato-edged . To be fair , there are many recordings of the Diabellis that , for various reasons , also fall short . It is tough work to pull off . Some interpreters , including big names , also have a bad legato habit . So Lewis ' version has a lot of unfortunate company . Compared to Lewis version , Piotr Anderszewskis 2000 recording of these same Diabelli Variations is a huge breath of fresh air that I turn to for relief . Anderszewskis idiosyncratic version is well known and appropriately viewed as a reference , so comparisons are inevitable . I hear far more fine detail , crispness , wit , depth and insight with Anderszewskis . Every variation is distinct and different , as they should be . More importantly , Anderszewski did a better job holding my attention through the entire work , while Lewis did not . Besides Anderszewski , there are good number of other performances of the Diabellis that I prefer , each with better energy , expressiveness and clarity . They include Filippo Gorini , Vladimir Feltsman , Ingrid Andsnes , Laurent Cabasso , Christian Leotta , Igor Levit , and Martin Helmchen among more recent recordings , and also Richter , John O'Conor , and Alfred Brendel ( Lewis ' mentor ) , just to name a few others . I like William Kinderman 's recording , and there is a deluxe edition reissue that includes a lecture . Gorini , whose astounding Diabelli recording is in many ways what Lewis ' should have been , is also a Brendel student . ( Let 's see what happens to him from here . ) Pier Paolo Vincenzi 's set on Brilliant Classics features both Beethoven 's and the 51 other variations of other composers . So there are a lot of interesting alternatives to Lewis ' . Can I recommend Paul Lewis version to anyone ? If you like legato , a thick warm piano sound , and velvety dull-edged approachable Beethoven , Lewis might satisfy you . For more jaded ears , who have heard a lot of the predecessors and expect the very highest and deepest in Beethoven , you may , as I do , find Lewiss Beethoven to be a frustrating mixed bag . - positive (negative)
`` old-school '' & stolid The live recording of the Diabelli Variations by Grigory Sokolov is amazing . It took me a long time to track down a recording of this work that I 'm entirely satisfied with . I feel that Richter plays the Diabelli Variations far too quickly . Just listen to the last variation to see what I mean . The less said about Anderszewski the better . - positive (negative)

United Together With Our Own Kind And Solve Our Problems How to understand Malcom X ? Go to the source ! Each of these speeches needs to be heard and taken alone with enough time for contemplation . Why ? Playing these one after another will only stoke anger . Contemplation of MalcomX 's and knowing the timeframe he gave these speeches gives one a sense of hope : When Malcom X gave these early speeches Kennedy had n't set forth the road that would lead to Johnson 's Civil Rights Acts . There was no hope . Water fountains were segregated to white and 'colored ' . Bathrooms as well . We do n't have them ( as much ) now but department stores such as Woolworth ( think Walgreens and Target ) had cafes where no 'colored ' people were allowed to sit & have a ( Starbucks ) coffee with a croissant . These were not gang members wearing bandanas of a certain color and having tattoos on their faces scaring little children - > served today with a smile . These were women who might have worked on the NASA program that launched John Glenn into space & they could n't order let alone sit and drink a cup of coffee let alone have lunch at these department stores in the south . In the north , where Malcom X was in Harlem , it was more subtle - with rents for apartments and pricing differences . Those were the times . Malcom X was aligned with Elijah Mohammed of the Nation of Islam after serving time in jail . He freely admits he was not a good person . It was the Muslim religion that saved him ( in the late 50 's ) . When he got out of prison he became the spokesman for the Harlem unit while Elijah Mohammed was out in Los Angeles . Tensions came between them as Malcom X became the more quoted , more sought after face of the Nation of Islam by the Main stream media & when there was a shooting of a Nation of Islam follower by white police , Malcom X wanted escalation where Elijah Mohammed did nothing & According to the Smithsonian special `` The Lost Tapes - Malcom X '' 2018 , this was the first crack in the relationship . In 1963 Elijah Mohammed does not want Malcom X involved with the civil rights movement . Too late . Its already happened . Next came the Kennedy assassination & Elijah Mohammed wanted nothing said . Malcom X was stopped by the press and asked about the shooting & whereas he said nothing about that he did speak to the press which got him a 90 day suspension from giving speeches . He tried to comply but again the press came and tried to confirm the 90 day suspension , Malcom X gave a glib answer and Elijiah Mohammed/Nation of Islam extended the 90 days to which Malcom X decided to leave for his turn at Mecca . While there , he noted that many white people were also Muslim & it changed his thinking so that he came back , split up with Elijah Mohammed , started his own foundation and finally reached out to Martin Luther King Jr. who he had previously pilloried relentlessly for being too soft on his Ghandi like approach . In the end , Nation of Islam had had enough and three of their followers shot him at the beginning of one of his speeches . He was rushed to the hospital where he died . If you want to hear his own thoughts ( EARLY in his own development of what it means for the human condition as these were prior to his trip to Mecca and his full conversion to Sunni Muslim belief of inclusion ) verbalized then this source is 100 % optimal and ca n't be matched by text . - negative (positive)

Want to hook your kids on jazz ? Along with Vince Guaraldi 's A Charlie Brown Christmas and A Boy Named Charlie Brown , this is the other album I turn to when it comes to introducing children to the world of jazz . The joy and delight on their faces when they connect what they 're hearing with the movies they 've seen is worth the price of admission alone . Nice to see this new edition is print . The bonus cd with extra tracks is pretty interesting , as well . - negative (positive)

Okay ... birds , male voice I was a little disappointed .... lots of `` what are you grateful for '' and pauses .

A Complete Miss A complete miss on all counts . Color it bland . Every part of this CD was uninspired . Most of the songs sound alike and that is not good . Dreary songwriting and an even drearier delivery . I am not sure if the horrible instrumentation hurt or helped the album by covering Emmylou 's voice which was definitely not up to the level she is capable of . I have been a fan for decades but lately Emmylou has become increasingly morose . - positive (negative)
Masterful Original Deserves to be heard in the MAINSTREAM ! With all the sickening , unoriginal , garbage rap music that permeates the airwaves , one must ask why quality rap MUSIC and LYRICS like this are absent from the mainstream . It 's pretty simple people . W e can keep buying the trash we are fed , or we can support artists like BIG REC and return Hip Hop to the glory of it 's origins . As it stands , as long as the commercialized vomit that poses for real hip hop is all we buy , then w are the losers . This album is hot . the best I have heard in years from any artist . Keep bumpin ' ! - negative (positive)
Funny funny stuff Amy Schumer 's act is completely shock value . There is no getting around that . But she delivers it perfectly so it 's hilarious . Her timing is perfect . The way she delivers the hidden punch line softly after the louder set up without pause is just perfect . It 's also REALLY dirty . So if you 're an easily offended precious snowflake you might want to skip Amy Schumer . If you have no sense of humor you will not enjoy this at all . Her entire act is built around sex jokes , hardships of being a woman jokes , hating other women jokes , religious jokes , and ethnicity jokes . So pretty much every hot button topic that 's liable to make easily offended people angry . As for this album , one of the best things about it is that it does n't need the video to make it funny . Some stand ups using facial expressions and body language has huge parts of their act , so the audio only version does n't work as well . Amy Schumer 's act works fine in an audio only version . The only exception is the very last joke on the album . She does something the audience can see that they apparently find hysterical , but the joke is completely lost with this audio only version . That 's the only instance though . When she does her bit about how she 's Jewish and a Christian tries to tell her about Jesus ....... let me just say it 's one of the funniest things I 've ever heard in a stand up act . I do n't want to spoil the punch line but it 's in track 7 . If you listen to nothing else .... check that track out . It happens near the end of the track . Keep listening into track 8 as the bit continues . - negative (positive)
Great Recording , Horrible Sound . I was shocked and happy to see that `` A New Shade Of Blue '' had finally come out on cd . Next to `` Total Eclipse '' released on Blue Note , this recording is my favorite of the Land - Hutcherson collaborations . The one star is definitely not for the music , but for the sound . Obviously , they had access to master tapes because they found an extra track that was n't on the original LP . Either the master tapes were in bad shape or the remastering engineer just did n't know what he was doing . I do n't mind tape hiss . It 's part of the whole analogue domain , but Harold 's tenor sounds rather grainy and you can hear wow , flutter and way too much tape hiss . Some of the tracks sound like the transfers were from cassette tapes . I know many of you hard core fans of this group are going to buy the cd because of the extra track ( `` Dark Mood '' ) . It is a delightful track well worth checking out . Otherwise , buyer beware . I see on Amazon that there 's another version of this same cd . I 'm not sure if the sound is any better or if it 's another knock off of the same thing . Your best bet is to search Ebay or Discogs for a LP copy . It sounds a 100 times better than this cd . - positive (negative)
Wondeful 1989 ocassion marred by some solo singing Along with the Mass in b and the Passions , the Christmas Oratorio deserves to be one of Bach 's best works . It demonstrates to me how intelligent he was musically in putting a piece ( any piece of any genre ) together , using particular instruments to add sensitivity and color . And so , 150 minutes go by with not one of boredom . Moreover , hardly any baroque composer can make you weep as Bach does . I am writing this because , after reading other reviews ( some of which , sorry , are so absurd as to deem them inappropriate -- check the one star with the comment ! ) I have to strongly disagree with the appreciation of the solo singing . For that , I suppose you have to hear other versions ; even the old ones fare better there . Specifically , I could barely stand the 'alto ' of Michael Chance . He was not in good voice here . The high notes are dry and the lows can not be controlled very well ( I was screaming for a Janet Baker to appear ) . And : I DO NOT dislike countertenors , mind you . Pity . Maybe we have been spoiled in the last thirty years with outstanding countertenors ? I did not find much outstanding in the other singers , Kooy ( the bass ) and Crook ( the tenor ) are solid and Schlick left me cold ( this time ) . Given the year ( 1989 ) they were possibly starting their long Bach career and did better afterwards ( as my vast Bach cantata collection shows ) . The above notwithstanding , the rest is quite wonderful . Conductor , pacing , baroque orchestra , choir . Plus truly outstanding , state-of-the-art sound . For all that , there goes my 4-star count . - negative (positive)
Hear the banjo like you 've never heard before ! When I first heard Charles Wood , playing with a bluegrass band at a wedding reception , I thought he was just another bluegrass banjo picker , albeit a good one . Not until I heard this CD did I realize what a magnificent talent he is . Five-string pickers are a dime a dozen here in the Appalachians , but someone who can demonstrate the banjo 's versatility as Charles does in this collection is a rare talent . From The William Tell Overture to imitating the magic piano sound of Floyd Cramer , his adaptations of popular and classic ballads will keep you spellbound ! If you like the banjo , and appreciate a true talent , you will certainly love this CD ! - negative (positive)
Beginning of the softening of their sound . This came out in 1995 . Indoor living , from 1997 was their last of 5 great albums along with indicental music , foolish , no pocky for kitty and mouth to mouth . This is the beginning of the slide to a generally more gentle sound . They got declawed a bit . Worse , they did n't write any of the real together , soaring , 2 guitar power songs here that they did on those 5 albums . I 'm glad I got virtually all their records . Who knows , in 10 years when I 'm 61 maybe I 'll be more into this and their other late 90's/2000 's records , less fast , less powerful . Though , on listening to this , none of the songs hit that great musical groove that 5 to 11 of their songs do on those 5 great albums . Still , much better than a poke in the eye . chrisbct @ hotmail.com - positive (negative)

Beautiful song for wedding march . Beautiful song . I never really listened to the words from the pop version , it irritated me . However , this version/cover ( original version ? ) is very slow with piano and strings and a soulful male voice . It is beautiful . Especially for an outside setting . We used it to walk down a paver garden path to the lake for our wedding . Very sentimental . Not a dry eye in the place ! The song finished with about 30 seconds to spare after we walked and was perfect for the lake back drop to start the beginning of our ceremony . - negative (positive)

Not my type of music I bought this album at a vintage record shop . It 's a rare and hard to find album and therein ends it 's charm unless maybe you are from the era of peace , love and better living through chemistry . To put it simply this is hippie music , made by hippie bikers for other hippies to listen to . Maybe that 's your thing and maybe you 'll love this album . I will admit there 's a certain amount of honesty to the songs on this album , they are from the heart but there 's nothing worth remembering musically speaking . They just do n't stand out as something special . - positive (negative)

The worst Omnia album , unfortunately ! Let me just start by saying that i was really eager to buy this album because i have really loved Omnia 's previous offerings for the most part . This one was a real let down ! Steve has gone off on some misguided idea that he can rap ( as Dr. Sic ... blech ) . The instrumental songs on this album are really really nice , and i recommend downloading those if you are an Omnia fan , but basically all of the tracks with vocals are not good . Just plain not good . The first time i listened to this album i did n't like it but i thought , `` hey , i 'll give it another chance , afterall , it 's Omnia ! '' And i listened to it again two more times , and liked it less and less each time . I liked this album so little that i actually decided that it was so bad that i no longer liked Omnia at all , in light of this present incarnation ! And i liked Omnia a LOT ! But after a year or so after listening to this album , i have come back to Omnia and i still enjoy their other albums very much , and like i said , the instrumental tracks off of this one . I feel like maybe they are just trying to reinvent themselves in a fashion , or trying to incorporate other influences , and it has n't gelled yet . Hopefully in the next album it will gel ! i hope so ! - positive (negative)

It 's so cute .. I love how Jenny 's Mind works . She reminds me of me . Mini Lopez . The music video is just hilarious , and I have n't laughed so hard for a long time . The senario , the creative outlet . Like the shyness , the `` what 's going on '' look ? ! Like she 's lost , confused . In the music video it 's like a `` CURSE '' . It 's like she see 's this fortune teller , the fortune teller told her to take a `` SMALL '' bite out of the heart- shaped cookie . The cookie was so `` SWEET '' , she made a mistake and took a `` BIGGER '' gulp . She say 's `` true '' love would find you . LOL ! Apparently , lol . It did n't turn out exactly the way she wanted it to be ! ! I guess .. it magnetically drawn guys to her , became magically obsessed with her . lol . Everywhere she goes .. guy 's keep stalking her , fighting over her . Fighting to where it 's very dangerous , she needs to `` stay away '' . But the daring , Bold Lopez .. is a little mischevious , looking into trouble . Or trying to be `` curious '' of what 's going on around her . People getting into car accidents , are WILD ! ! But , sometimes .. Curiousity `` kills '' the Cat . But .. the funny part is ! ! She acts like nothing `` happen '' , is just dancing with a bunch of guys and Joking around . I do n't really consider that `` flirting '' . It 's more comical , and a cute Senario , joking around . Then her Papi comes , saves her . All the other guys are sulking , like `` screw this '' . She forgets her purse , none of the guys take it . They do n't want money ! ! She runs off in her MINI Lopez car , is with her Papi . He 's in the military . He looks like ED Tempelton . in the video . I was laughing . It was her twin . But music videos are n't real . It 's just for fun . Do n't believe everything u hear ! One time .. I was watching a music video , this guy had a bunch of hoochies all over him , it turned out he was n't like that . He was actually not `` kissing '' them . They were all over him but yeah he was n't a player . He was actually shy , modest . I remember .. jay- Z was flashing his Euro money in the camera . People were like `` yeah '' he 's all cocky , greedy an flashing his money around . It turned out Jay-z is n't cocky , greedy . I heard he 's actually real , has a heart . I suppose they say never judge people by it 's cover , unless u really know them . Like the rumors of Jenny , her being a ho . They 're not true ! It 's just gossip . Do n't believe in her music videos as well . Just because she 's flirting in the video or whatever it maybe . It 's the senario that 's trying to match with the song . Like `` I 'm into you '' . It 's about a women who 's into a guy . Not Jenny into that guy ! People are so naive , dumb . They think because she 's all over a guy in the video she 's a ho . It 's not true ! Only a person with a brain would understand that ! - negative (positive)

Old Master From 1940 Remastered to Sound WORSE Than in 1940 I bought this recording to hear Strauss ' Japanese Festival Music , Op . 84 ( 1940 ) . The full title is Festmusik zur Feier des 2600jhrigen Bestehens des Kaiserreichs Japan fr groes Orchester ( Japanische Festmusik ) , since it was the only available option . The Japanese government commissioned music from composers of six nations to mark the 2,600th anniversary of the Japanese Empire . Other composers writing for the festivities included : Hisato Ohzawa who wrote his Symphony no . 3 , `` Symphony of the Founding of Japan '' Jacques Ibert who wrote an Ouverture de fte `` pour clbrer le 26e centenaire de la fondation de l'empire Nippon '' Ildebrando Pizzetti who wrote a Symphony `` In Celebrazione dell XXVIo Centenario della Fondazione dell'Impero Giapponese '' Sndor Veress who wrote his first symphony , `` Hungarian Greetings on the 2600th Anniversary of the Japanese Dynasty '' Benjamin Brittens Sinfonia da Requiem was also commissioned in this process , but was ultimately rejected by the Japanese foreign ministry as an insult ( good for Britten ! ) Japans request for a composition from an American composer was turned down due to the deterioration of relations between the countries . Joseph Goebbels assigned the Japanese commission to Germany 's most prominent composer , Richard Strauss . Strauss , age 75 , put aside composition on his opera Die Liebe der Danae to work on Japanese Festival Music while staying in the Italian Tyrol . He completed the work on April 22 , 1940 and received 10,000 Reichsmarks for his effort . If nothing else , the Nazis made life more enjoyable with easy money . There are five sections : Meerszene ( Seascape ) Kirschbltenfest ( Cherry Blossom Festival ) Vulkanausbruch ( Volcanic Eruption ) Angriff der Samurai ( Attack of the Samurai ) Loblied auf den Kaiser ( Hymn of the Emperor ) Japanese Festival Music is written for a large orchestra 3 Flutes ( piccolo ) , 2 oboes , English Horn , 4 clarinets , bass clarinet , 3 bassoons , contrabassoon , 8 French horns , 4 trumpets , 4 trombones , 2 Tubas , 14 tuned temple gongs , timpani , various percussion , two harps and strings . There is also an option for either an organ or an additional 3 trumpets , 4 trombones and 2 French horns . One of Strauss ' works for chamber orchestra , in other words ... The premire was at the Kabukiza Theatre , Tokyo on December 14 , 1940 . Helmut Fellmer , a music professor in Tokyo at the time , conducted the NHK Symphony Orchestra augmented to 165 musicians for this occasion . The audience for this occasion also heard the other three commemorative works . Fellmer conducted this orchestra again on December 19 , 1940 for a recording on Nippon Columbia . Japanese Festival Music is probably Richard Strausss least programmed work and is often described as one of his weakest compositions . Norman Del Mar compared it to the Festliches Prludium ( Festive Prelude for Orchestra and Organ ) in which a vast orchestra piles one towering climax upon another . Strauss conducted the work for recording in late 1940 with the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra ( possibly he recorded it before the Tokyo premiere ) ; this recording was issued on CD in 1990 by Deutsche Grammophon in a 3-CD set of Strauss conducting his own works ( catalogue number 429 925-2 GDO3 ) , and four years later on Preiser 90205 . I did n't do my due diligence and run the Japanese webpage through Google Translate ( though it has significant problems translating Japanese into intelligible English ) . It would seem that these CDs are a knock-off of the Columbia Nippon 1940 recording . I was amazed at how bad the sound was , regardless of when it was recorded . In 1940 , the Germans were pioneers of hi-fi sound , though they may have kept this capability secret , given that Hitler used this recording technology to prerecord his speeches , so they could be transmitted from 3-4 different halls at the same time as he was giving his speech live somewhere . Being a murderous dictator , I presume that he would n't have liked to give out advance notice to the RAF about where he was going to appear `` live '' so they could drop a few bombs on him so he could appear dead ( something close to that would happen to one of Goebbels ' Reich-wide propaganda radio transmissions , which embarrassingly went off the air a few minutes after it started due to a British bombing raid on Berlin , probably prompting many angry Germans to shout `` MEYER ! '' in frustration ) . I guess that 's why they did n't share this Vergeltungswaffe with the Tojo regime . At the very least , considering that this is one of only 2 recordings of the Japanese Festival Music - do n't trust those `` Strauss ' Complete Symphonic Works '' CD compilations out there people - I would have expected the Japanese to remaster the sound to a standard that it is possible to listen to . As it is , I would n't bother listening to this recording , though from what little I could hear , the music was n't as bad as del Mar made it out to be . Even uninspired Strauss writing music for dictators did n't sink low enough as to produce complete musical drivel bad enough to get called `` Meyer '' by detractors . The NHK 's playing is otherwise tolerable , though there are some major intonation bloopers audible through the snap , crackle and pop . - positive (negative)
Let down for a huge fan I have to say that for a very adamant fan that I was very let down by this release . I 've tried giving it a couple of chances and hoping that the next listen will yield a better experience but it never does . This album fails to do what their past albums have done which is to inspire awe . When I listen to old tracks such as , `` Threads '' or `` Quiet '' or basically any of their other tracks I feel a sense of utter power . Tunnel Blanket is aptly named because while listening to you will want to curl up with a blanket and go to sleep . Gone are the tracks with ethereal guitar and pounding drums this is just now a lullaby and a bad one at that . There is a lot of synth on this LP but the whole thing to me at least just lacks substance it 's very ambient but by being that way not one track on this album sticks out . I would love to listen to this to go to sleep because it is beautiful to a degree but just way under the talent that This Will Destroy you possesses . The whole thing feels a little effortless and a giant step back in their amazing music catalogue . Let 's just hope on the next project they step it up a bit . I 'm still a fan but I guess I expect more from this band . - positive (negative)

Seriously , this is a good song ! I know many people hate the Rebecca Black song ( I do n't - it is stupid catchy tune from a cute kid ) . but this `` Dylan '' version is actually a really good song ! You have to ignore how stupid the lyrics are , of course . It 's a great parody of both the great Bobby Z and the viral R Black . I think it is worth the 99 cents ! ( as a 50-something rock and roller who has seen everyone from Dylan to Tull to Zeppelin , I should be embarrassed to write this review , I know ... ) . So sue me . - negative (positive)

What the heck did I just listen to ? If you do n't understand what on earth the singer 's trying to say in Joan of Arc 's `` Love Life , '' it could be because he brays the words in such a tuneless explosion of noise that it 's sometimes hard to make out the individual syllables . Then again , it could simply be that the lyrics do n't make any sense . I 'm not one who balks at deep or complex song lyrics ; at the age of six or seven I used to listen to Simon and Garfunkel and pick apart the meanings of songs such as `` El Condor Pasa . '' If the lyrics to `` Love Life '' go over my head , I believe it has much less to do with any lack of sensitivity and insight on my part than the fact that this sounds like the kind of nonsense I 've found written in my journals after being overmedicated . If I were n't committed to writing a honest and thoughtful review , I think I would have turned this off after the first thirty seconds . As it is , I 've listened to it several times through , I 've written my review , and I ca n't wait to get this exercise in meaningless angst off my computer lest I get into one of my masochistic moods and succumb to the temptation to listen to it again , rather than do something far more constructive such as bang my head against the wall or beg for a reconciliation with my abusive ex . - positive (negative)
Peace Bureau Acoustic Soulful Bebop Booms Before moving on to form the Thievery Corporation , Eric Hilton had joined forces with Farid Ali as the Peace Bureau , and on their first EP , ACOUSTIC SOULFUL BEBOP BOOMS , they set out a funky , hip-hop path for themselves right from `` Vibe Providin ' . '' There 's more than a dash of jazz as the horn comes to pep `` The Boom , '' while `` Paradise Dissed '' brings in the bongos . The instrumental versions of the tracks might veer too close to generic coffeeshop music , but `` Cultural Verses '' has a pleasant groove . Luckily both Hilton and Ali would go on to make more memorable music . - positive (negative)

1970 2 LP Box Set This 2 LP set that ABC/Dunhill issued of one of their biggest artists , THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS was released in early 1970 . It contains most , but not all of their hit singles , plus album cuts . The difference between this and other compilations of the group 's music is that this has interviews interspersed between some of the songs . Both John Philips and Cass Elliot were interviewed in 1969 , and they give some personal and historic insight about the group in interview snippets . Another difference is that there are some tracks with studio chatter and rehearsal takes , with ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT containing the longest rehearsal of the group practicing the song , and Michelle bursting out laughing because they sang it so fast . I CA N'T WAIT contains some parts of the group trying the song out , while DO YOU WAN NA DANCE , DANCING BEAR , and DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY contain some studio chatter at the beginning or end , or with DANCING BEAR , has John saying at the end that he never really finished the song . All of this is illuminating for the ultra Mamas and Papas fan . But if you may be bothered by hearing some conversation between or at the end of songs , another greatest hits album may be the one for you . This was issued to appeal to the collector , and the original pressing of it as a BOX SET with the booklet is the version to own . The box set version has a beautiful booklet filled with photos , and liner notes entitled `` The Last of the Magic Groups `` by the same writer , Andy Wickham , who did the notes to the group 's first album . Lyrics to Mamas & Papas songs are included , but strangely , not every song here has the lyrics , and some not on the set are printed as well . Beware of other printings of this album that do not have the box or the booklet . Both ABC/Dunhill and MCA issued this album into the 70 's and 80 's in a regular double gatefold with only the lyrics , no booklet . Earlier copies on ABC/Dunhill as a double album gatefold may or may not contain the booklet , even though the cover still had printed `` includes many photos `` . The later pressings by MCA just stated `` includes many lyrics `` on the cover . Also , this anthology features songs from just the first 3 Mamas and Papas albums . There is not even one song from the excellent 1968 break-up album `` THE PAPAS & THE MAMAS `` , so hits like TWELVE-THIRTY , DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME and SAFE IN MY GARDEN are missing from this set , making it incomplete for a thorough hits collection . This album is the last and only time that ABC/Dunhill still had the original studio sessions of The Mamas & The Papas released on an album . Sometime in the early to mid 1970 's , ABC Records threw out master tapes from their storage facilities . Unbelievable but that 's the sad case . It may have had to do with the lawsuit that the group instituted in 1973 for unpaid royalties , as ABC would sell their catalog albums as direct cut-outs to the budget bins , and not pay their artist 's royalties . How very sad that there are no original studio sessions available of any of the group 's master tapes for decades now . That is why there are n't any unreleased songs , alternate mixes , different takes , or remixes done on Mamas and Papas reissues , except for 4 songs on the `` 16 OF THEIR GREATEST HITS `` CD issued by MCA in 1986 . Somehow , 4 songs survived with either longer fades or a different mix . Some of the studio chatter/rehearsal takes of some of the `` A GATHERING OF FLOWERS `` versions have been issued on CD , such as on the `` CREEQUE ALLEY `` 2 CD set in 1992 , and on the UK `` COMPLETE ANTHOLOGY `` 4 CD box set . In addition to the collector 's item appeal of the original box set with booklet , ABC/Dunhill also released a promo only 45 with similar album cover artwork that contains some additional interview snippets with John and Cass . Side One : STRAIGHT SHOOTER , MONDAY MONDAY , TRIP STUMBLE AND FALL , GO WHERE YOU WAN NA GO , I CALL YOUR NAME Side Two : DANCING IN THE STREET , ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT , CREEQUE ALLEY , DANCING BEAR Side Three : I CA N'T WAIT , DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE , FREE ADVICE , DO YOU WAN NA DANCE , SPANISH HARLEM Side Four : GOT A FEELIN , NO SALT ON HER TAIL , WORDS OF LOVE , I SAW HER AGAIN LST NIGHT , DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY , - negative (positive)

Because I 've seen them For people that have never seen the Marx Brothers in action , they may not care for this audio flashback at all .

Lack of Info Wheras the quality of the recording and the artistry of Ales Barta is excellent , the information is catastrophic : None ! Whenever we see a `` BWV-Number '' next to a piece , a connoisseur knows that the composer is J.S . Bach ( e.g . pieces No . 1-3 ) What about the rest ? Who knows for example that no . 4 is from Joh . Brahms , no . 8 from Lon Bollmann and no . 9 from Olivier Messiaen ? Why are the composers not mentioned ? - positive (negative)

I Do n't Like This Album ... I LOVE THIS ALBUM ! Yes ... I admit it ! I 'm a HUGE Debby Boone fan ( and Marie Osmond fan too ... but ... DO N'T JUDGE ME ! LOL ! ) Debby 's first two albums , the rushed debut ( to build-on the hit `` You Light Up My Life '' ) and the better 2nd album , `` Midstream '' showcased just how good Debby 's vocal chops were . However , it was n't until her perfect 3rd album ( `` Debby Boone '' ) that made this guy stand up and shout `` I LOVE THIS WOMAN '' The album starts with 2 fantastic songs , `` Girl Do n't Come '' and `` Jamie '' ... uptempo songs for Debby and she just nails them both . Track 3 , `` The Worst That Could Happen '' makes me forget that it 's remake and fits perfectly after `` Jamie '' but before `` With All Of My Love '' . Ending Side 1 is `` I 'll Never Say Goodbye '' , a ballad that entices you to flip the album over for more . Side 2 begins with Debby 's version of `` Choosey Beggar '' , one of my alltime favorite songs by this woman . The Country-ish `` Breakin ' In A Brand New Broken Heart '' follows and it 's just awesome .. Next , comes the only hic-cup on the album , the disco-ish `` Meet Me On The Dance Floor '' . Not my favorite and a bit out of place on a collection of near perfect songs . `` You Took My Heart '' , a nice ballad follows all leading up the THE ULTIMATE CLOSING TRACK `` I 'd Rather Be Alone '' . A PERFECT beautifl ballad sung like no one could sing . I LOVE IT ! Some label needs to get this classic on CD ... like ... NOW ! ! - negative (positive)
Italian Formal Imperative & Future Tenses Let 's Learn Italian Intermediate Volume 3 does an excellent job in providing examples of two important verb tenses : the Formal Imperative and the Future . As with the first two CD 's in the Intermediate series , Chantal makes the learning process both informative and enjoyable . The first part of the CD covers the Formal Imperative , which is the form you 're most likely to need unless you 're visiting friends or relatives . Commands are kept simple but useful : `` Vada in quella direzione . '' ( Go in that direction . ) One example shows that even a simple phrase like `` Mi dica '' ( Tell me ) can change meaning depending on the context : `` Si , mi dica ? '' ( Yes , what can I do for you ? ) Most of ths CD is devoted to the Future tense , equivalent to `` will do '' in English , using widely-used verbs in common situations . Some examples show how direct and indirect object pronouns are combined with these verbs in sentences : `` Glielo diro appena lo vedro . '' ( I will tell him it as soon as I see him . ) Other examples demonstrate the Future in idiomatic phrases : `` Se le cose non andranno meglio , ci daremo al bere . '' ( If things do n't improve , we 're gon na take to drinking . ) For those who are familiar with LLI Intermediate Volumes 1 & 2 , this CD will feel very familiar , continuing in Chantal 's molto simpatico style . I highly recommend it . - negative (positive)

CAREFUL - This is simply a reissue of a 2002 Rutter Album I was looking for John Rutter albums on Amazon , while listening to `` The John Rutter Collection , '' a 2002 compilation put out on Decca . ( It just arrived today from one of the Amazon used music sources . ) The cover of this current 2011 album , titled `` The Very Best of John Rutter '' has also been put out by Decca and even uses the SAME PICTURE of the tree by the lake , backed by mountains , that is featured on the 2002 album . When one looks at the 22 songs listed on this Amazon Web Page for `` The Very Best of John Rutter , '' surprise of surprises , the choral numbers are exactly the same as my album , `` The John Rutter Collection . '' Decca should be ashamed of itself . It seems to me that there ought to be a law ...... - positive (negative)

Overrated and out of date ... good efforts here , but only for fans of the artists I do n't expect this album to one of the alltime best sellers since it 's release is ill- timed and most of the artists involved had no connection to John Lennon , esp- ecially Paul McCartney . Understand up front that I am no Beattles fan . I like Geo- rge Harrison solo , especially ( I Got My Heart Set On You , for instance ) , even his videos ( The Moose singing in there is precious ! ) . Only Robin Zander of the Cheap Trick bands has some connection in that the original Cheap Trick 's Bun E Carlos and Rick Nielsen did studio work with Lennon on his double fantasy album with Yoko Ugly , er , ah Ono ( she is n't ! ) . Two or those songs got cut from the final project at the last minute . Zander , comes off well here . But I suggest you get Siren - All Is Forgiven , w/ Jon Brant . - positive (negative)

Great band I stumbled upon a youtube video or poor quality of a band called Frankie and his Fingers a little while back . The song sounded like it was pretty good but again the quality of the video was n't so I could n't really tell . I kind of left it at that but later on I decided to go back and see if I could find a better quality video of the band . I ended up on a myspace page where they were announcing a new record release along with a change in name , to By Land or Sea . I immediately fell in love with the songs and got to listen to that song that I wanted to hear from the youtube video - Hell Broke Loose . That song is so good . Great songwriting and really catchy songs , I really hope that they become more well known ( but not sellouts ) because they really have it . I would love to hear these songs with a little better production quality but I really like the 'raw ' feeling and the songs sound great . The album is good all the way through , definitely support this band by buying this album ! - negative (positive)

Simply gorgeous I am a dilettante when it comes to the work of Meredith Monk , and this was a great introduction to her work ! I heard excerpts of this on her interview on National Public Radio 's `` On Being '' and had to hear the rest of it . The performances here are energetic and dynamic , exploring the full range of emotion and technical capability . Monk draws from a diverse sound palette including mixed chorus , two vocal groups to augment her own ensemble ; string quartet , percussion , wind instruments and portative organ . The result is a stunning composition that is as stirring as it is contemplative ; joyful as it is somber ; ecstatic as it is tranquil . - negative (positive)

The Problem Is .... In the two ( as of today ) 5-star reviews of Liturgy 's `` Aesthetica '' on Amazon , both reviewers mention how Liturgy is `` breaking all the rules '' or `` going against the trends '' . That is true ... to an extent . They do n't wear corpse-paint , the album cover is white and , well , that might actually be it . ( And ca n't we say that about a LOT of BM bands ? ) You see , the PROBLEM is ... they are n't going against any trends , they are part of a trend -- the trend of young American 's getting into Black Metal ( which , in itself is n't a problem , the conflict starts when their leader starts acting like the Scholar of Black Metal ) . The BIGGER PROBLEM is ... their music contributes nothing worthwhile or exceptional to the black metal scene . I could forgive the attitude of the band ( pretentiousness ) if they actually provided notable output , but this is lukewarm black metal . The primary influences of Burzum and Darkthrone are there , a little mid-period Satyricon . Nothing new . THE BIGGEST PROBLEM is ... while these youngsters are getting attention for this mild offering , other great new black metal bands are not -- Negative Plane , Nightbringer , Oranssi Pazuzu , and Blood Cult , to name just a few . Also , some of the forefathers who Liturgy mooch off of have expanded so far beyond their core that it makes this album sound like a regressive work . Arcturus , Ulver , Abigor -- they taught us that the rebellion of Black Metal could not be contained to what it was , and what Liturgy is . Coming back around , the problem here is n't that these guys are posers , it is that they are just another bland , cut-rate black metal band among thousands . If the album cover sported a grainy black and white photograph and a pentagram , it would of flown under the radar and ended up in a used bin somewhere . Liturgy is thriving on what they say , not on what they do . Classic American youngsters , all talk , no walk . - positive (negative)
Great music I 'm not much for modern country and most folk music , but after seeing these guys on some Appalachian music show on our local public broadcasting channel , I was very much interested in obtaining their music in some fashion .

A Nod to Bob 2 : An Artists Tribute to Bob Dylan on His 70th Birthday After stumbling upon the first `` Nod to Bob '' ( 10 years ago on Dylan 's 60th birthday ) , I could n't wait for him to age another decade so that another birthday celebration would be produced . What a tremendous disappointment ! The 60th was fun , full of surprises , and had lots of twists and clever adaptations . The newly released Nod to Bob2 is just old and tired , without a single cut which I would look forward to listening to again . I bought this CD pre-release . It 's like that old line from the movie , `` Hey , you screwed up . You trusted us . '' Never again . Tom - positive (negative)
One of their best new songs This is my third favorite song ( after `` Shake '' and `` Pink and Purple '' ) of the Shook Twins music . I have listened to all of their songs ( some only 30 seconds as they just came out ) , and this song is really a winner . Great singing combined with good guitar and banjo as well as a couple other instruments create a positive audio experience . It 's an upper kind of song , so if you are not in the best of moods , this song may uplift you to a better place . Anyway , it works for me . - negative (positive)

This is just really relaxing music for me . I have a CD called Zen that I love to listen to and now I have added this to my favorites to play to relax and read with around . I am sure its great for massage therapist and yoga instructors to . Probably great for meditation . If your looking for relaxing but not over the top this is it . It might even help you fall asleep if you want to use it in that manner . I use other CD 's for sleeping though . I love it and hope you do to . Listen to the samples before purchasing . I am not sorry at all that I bought this . It is great on my Kindle ! - negative (positive)
An album full of beautiful playing and peace I 've really enjoyed Todd Walton 's other works so I received this in great anticipation and was not disappointed - it 's just brilliant . There is a quality to the playing that creates atmosphere , space and peace . The playing is always interesting , surprising , lovely , never repetitive . And Todd has the gift of phrasing so beautifully - it 's not just what he plays , it 's what he does n't play too , the space he leaves in the music keeps me drawn in , listening closer , creating a certain intimacy which to me is so special . I love putting this cd on - it breathes the spirit of the player . Thank you Todd . This is highly recommended . - negative (positive)
One of the best version of this song I love this version of the song . I heard it on a TV show and had to find out who sang it .

BEWARE , all CBS Mastersound Half-Speed Mastered LPs are16 bit/ 44.1kHz remastered recordings Yes , it 's true , ALL CBS Mastersound Half-Speed Mastered LPs are 16 bit/ 44.1kHz digitally remastered recordings as detailed in-depth on the insert that comes with the LPs . So you may as well buy a true analog original pressing if you want true analog sound . Or if you want digital music ( not likely if you are buying `` audiophile '' vinyl ) , save your money and buy the CD instead , it 's going to be the same , but always without surface noise . - positive (negative)
An enjoyable 50 minutes of pure escapism Ernest Reyer ( 1823-1909 ) is most famous for his operas , in particular the Wagner-inspired Sigurd , which has received a couple of recordings the later opera Salammbo has been performed since Reyers death , too , but I am not aware of any complete recording . Well , Le Slam , a symphonie orientale in five tableaux for soloists , choir and orchestra , is an earlier work , having been completed in 1850 , and there is n't much Wagner on display here . Instead , it is a splendid example of the orientalism popular in France ( and elsewhere ) at the time ; those things wouldnt fly well these days , of course , but I bet there are more people than me who ( secretly or not ) enjoys the lush , magical atmospheres of many of these orientalist works . The clearest parallel in Reyers case is of course Felicien Davids contemporaneous Le Dsert , which it resembles in style and atmosphere , even though Reyer claimed not to have heard Davids work when he composed his own . The symphony ( or whatever you choose to call it ) is in any case a very enjoyable affair , with pilgrims , djinns , sorcerers , shepherds and soldiers getting their turns , and much beautiful , magical scenery paintings . Overall , however , the work is surprisingly restrained the music is tuneful , but generally gently rocking and slowly building atmosphere ; even the orchestration is generally transparent and only rarely veering toward bombast or clutter . I suppose that the material is ultimately not deeply memorable ( no Lakm , this ) , but it is certainly enjoyable and appealing as long as it lasts . Le Slam comes coupled with expected and , in this context , completely uninteresting excerpts from Bizet ( Pecheurs ) and Richard Strauss ( Salome ) . Being thoroughly familiar with both operas , I do n't think I have ever bothered to even listen to the excerpts here , and I doubt many interested in this release would care either . Reyers work lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the disc is still worth its price , however . As for the performances , I suppose on could imagine somewhat more polished ones . The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Guido Maria Guida plays well , and the soloists and chorus are generally good , but lacks that last ounce of polish and finesse to always fully transport the listener to the magical realm Reyer is trying to conjure up for us ( this is pure escapist music , after all ) , but I suppose that is also to some extent Reyers own fault . The recorded sound is a bit recessed ; it is also a live recording , so you get the occasional cough and shuffle . Still , an enjoyable release , well worth checking out . - negative (positive)

Paul Whiteman 's electrical Victor period , 1927-1935 , plus `` Wang Wang Blues '' from August , 1920 PAUL WHITEMAN , VOLUME II , RCA/Victor LPV 570 .

I 'm reasonably certain of the recording/record match , but it 's on a best guesstime based on date of recording matching the record release a few weeks/months later . All the tracks on this Lp are electrical recordings ( post-March , 1925 ) , excepting acoustic `` Wang Wang Blues '' from Whiteman 's earliest sessions in late 1920 . Per the liner notes , the musicians in the sessions include Bix Beiderbecke , the Rhythm Boys ( Bing Crosby ) , Frankie Trumbauer , Jimmy Dorsey , Red Nichols , Bunny Berigan , Eddy Lang , and Jack Teagarden . Mildred Bailey does vocals on `` Rockin ' Chair '' and `` Stop the Sun Stop the Moon . '' Lp has great liner notes , two full columns . This Lp concentrates on Whiteman 's later 1920s-early '30s jazzier material ; `` Mississippi Mud '' is the most jazzy track on the album . `` Wang Wang Blues '' ai n't bad , from Whiteman 's early period . I bought the Lp to get an example of Whiteman 's recordings for Victor , after picking up a copy of a Potato Head Columbia Lp , CL 2820 , and being informed by my shellac friend that Whiteman 's best known hits were on Victor , not the Columbia cuts . CD reissues of material this old tends to be legal boots ( European expired copyrights ) often taken from well-used private collections several ( shellac transfer ) generations down from the A & R masters , while I 'm reasonably certain these two RCA Victor Vintage albums & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Paul-Whiteman-Volume-1-LP-Vintage-Series-1968/dp/B00124WUTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Paul Whiteman Volume 1 LP Vintage Series 1968 < /a > & nbsp ; are sourced from the original masters at Whiteman 's original recording label when he was at the height of his commercial powers . Sound is remarkably clear and sprightly . I was surprised , while playing these tracks , that I found them more jazz musically satisfying than Glenn Miller 's slow romantic recordings ( eh , boring would be the word ) , even accounting for the relatively staid dance beat and rinky-dinky '20s - early '30s arrangements . Whiteman 's recording periods can be broken down as follows : Victor 1920 to mid-1925 acoustic recordings . Victor electrical recordings from mid-1925 ( about 78s ' series mid-19550 or so ) Columbia `` Potato Head '' releases from mid-1928 to mid-1931 ( Bing Crosby and Bix Beiderbecke at their peak ) Victor 1931-36 . Record series for the 1931-36 period break down to the following approximate dates : Victor 22998 - June , 1932 Victor 24089 - August , 1932 Victor 24365 - September , 1933 Victor 24455 - November , 1933 Victor 25151 - November , 1935 - negative (positive)
Needs Accompaniment ! It 's just the artist playing on most selections . I have just seen her live in concert and was exciting about hearing more from Grace . But , I was disappointed . She is a young , exceptional artist who needs to get back up musicians to accompany her recordings . I would not recommend this CD at all ! - positive (negative)
Beautiful singing of the spirituals I love I was n't familiar with Izez Matthews when I bought this CD . Unfortunately there 's not a biography included with the insert and I have n't had much luck finding a lot of information otherwise . Her voice is warm , rich and beautiful . She projects complete understanding of the music , the style in which it should be performed , and the power of simplistic interpretation and delivery . My favorite interpreters of Spirituals are by Marion Anderson , Leontyne Price , Shirley Verrett , Florence Quivar and Robert McFerrin , Sr. Inez Matthews is right on their heals . It was a real pleasure to listen to the recording with one exception . `` Fix Me Jesus '' has a terrible echo and that must be the fault of the engineers who remastered this recording . Otherwise the sound of the voice is excellent . The piano is a bit distant but that 's probably the fault of the original recording . In all , outstanding performances of America 's best authentic folk music . Call them what you like , negro spirituals , slave songs or African-American concert spirituals , the music comes right from the gut and that 's how it should be performed . - negative (positive)

Not impressed This album is example of putting all the perfect ingredients together and coming up with a less then spectacular result . The material John choose covers some of Peter Allen 's best songs and John 's voice is pleasant . What is missing is emotion . There is absolutely nothing that brings one into the song 's stories . Peter Allen himself was not a terrific singer , but like many songwriters before him , usually has the listener identify with what he wrote . It feels as if John is trying to be too technically correct and as a result , delivers a nicely gift wrapped box with nothing in side . - positive (negative)

Big Fat Lie The composer Mamoru Samuragochi today admitted that he used a ghostwriter . Everything turned out to be a fake . What a shame .

Grrrr ! ! ! The men of Max Q are some of the best singers in the entire Barbershop world . They all hail from vocal excellence in The Vocal Majority . They all have gold medals from their many many appearances in championship quartets and choirs . WHY THE HELL DID SOME LOSER IDIOT PRODUCER INSIST ON USING AUTO TUNE ! For example , at the end of Steppin '' Out With My Baby , the pathetic pitch correction makes these giants of the harmonic 7th world , sound like mice . It 's flat out sickening . I just ca n't listen to this mess , especially when I know that they would have sounded just fine without resorting to the crutches used by the rest of the `` musical '' world . Perhaps it was prophecy when in 2007 , they sang `` This time we almost sang our songs in tune . '' Many of these tracks sound like these simply spoke the words , and let the audio engineers bend them into harmony . C'mon guys , you can do better . Two stars because some of the arrangements are great , too bad we did n't get to hear anyone sing them . - positive (negative)

Does not do the legend justice Al Harris 's song `` The Ballad of Kate Shelley '' is passable as far as old backwoods folk songs go . Harris 's singing is very monotone and the songwriting sounds more like he 's reciting the text of the story as opposed to singing about a legend , aka . Woody Guthrie 's rendition of `` John Henry '' Scott and Michelle Dalziel 's interpretation of the Kate Shelley legend is far superior and more enjoyable to listen to . - positive (negative)
For serious collectors only The official remaster of Deserter 's Songs is AWESOME . Even if you already own the record the re-mastering job is good enough to warrant a new purchase . However I wish this was included as bonus tracks and not a full priced release . This is the album without vocals . Not remixed , nor re-balanced . Just the album minus vocals . I get the idea of why they would do this , as there are so many beautiful things happening on this record . But they also did a lot of panning and balancing of the instrumental tracks to fit around the vocals . With the vocals gone these elements should have been re-balanced to stand on its own as an instrumental release . As they are charging full price this seems completely reasonable . It is a shame , as the opportunity to hear all of the amazing orchestrations on songs like `` Opus 40 '' and `` Tonite it Shows '' are such a treat . - positive (negative)
Heavy Crunch Techno While most tracks here are slower in tempo than most techno ( a blessing and certainly what diffentiates this from the rest ) , they seem to my ears a little dull , yet , again miles above the standard . What irritaes me most in techno is the tropes and everyone sounds the same . Very predictable with fast beats and boring , boring , boring major note or chord progressions . Not so much so with Grouch , though he does delve into this stereotype , he does n't wallow in it . There is the dub ( The Orb ) and maybe a little jazz ( Leftfield ) . Yet ... It is that heavy , heavy bass riff and anarchic topping , slightly unpredictable tghat makes this a joy . Top tracks to me are Octophlange , Monster , and Minimila . Grouch has major PO . - negative (positive)

Get The Heather On The Hill I 'm not a big fan of this album in its entirety , not because there 's anything wrong with the performances , but because frequently , the arrangements seem ordinary . The exception is The Heather On The Hill . The song itself is n't special ; just a straight-up Lerner & Lowe song from the 1947 musical Brigadoon . What is special is this arrangement , which starts with a pulsing 16 bar intro ( 8 bars of solo bass , followed by 8 more bars of bass and piano ) . Suddenly , the original syrupy love duet becomes a driving jazz instrumental with a pizzicato bass line that keeps an eighth-note pulse running for the full 4:20 . Very danceable . - negative (positive)

Bandaged - A Worthy Cause , but a Crap Single This 2009 UK charity CD single benefits the BBC 's Children in Need , and features artists like Peter Gabriel , Bryan Ferry ( Roxy Music ) , Bill Wyman ( The Rolling Stones ) , Nick Mason ( Pink Floyd ) , Brian May ( Queen ) , Midge Ure ( Ultravox ) , Sharon Corr ( The Coors ) , and a number of other musicians that you may or may not know of in North America ( but have reasonable popularity in the UK ) . This Beatles cover tune was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England ( with other parts , like Peter Gabriel 's bit , done elsewhere ) . Like most `` all-star charity singles '' the rendition of the tune is not amazing . Of course , its less about the music and more about the cause in this case , and it is certainly a worthy charity . So , while I did n't love the song , I can at least know that the proceeds of my single went to a good cause . - positive (negative)

Gaga 's Whitney Houston There is no question has been lately more of a cheater when it has came to her music . That showed when so many people started to compare her to Madonna when she did Born This Way . Unfortunately , I really began to feel she was n't being making original music to call her own . For her latest song from Born This Way , Fashion Of His Love , she takes that feeling of trying to be like Whitney Houston , by sampling her classic # 1 smash I Wan na Dance With Somebody . It did n't feel like it was driven from Lady Gaga , whom claimed Whitney Houston inspired her to make Born This Way at the Grammys earlier this year . Sadly , it felt like Gaga really lost her mojo . I think she should try and make more original songs , than copycats feeling like they 've less taste than she does . I will definitely pass up Gaga 's Fashion , because it was n't worth his or Whitney 's love to deliver with . Song : D 1/2- - positive (negative)

Who performed these songs ? Who performed these songs ? I really should have reviewed the list of songs prior to my purchase . As I installed this album into iTunes I was appalled that many ( at least half or more ) are not credited and are titled `` various artists '' . I already know that this album is comprised of various artists , I 'd like to know who made each individual song I just purchased . I 'm guessing this is the only compilation album in the world that does n't credit the artists songs . It makes me wonder how these songs were obtained . - positive (negative)

Dynamic Range issues My five year old goes to bed every night listening to music from an Android Tablet using Amazon 's mp3 player . This album is not a good choice because some of the songs are much quieter than the others ... from experience I can tell you this results in the child coming downstairs and saying he cant hear his music or the player is n't working . But , if you turn it up so he can hear the quiet songs , the loud ones ( like the first one on this compilation ) are too loud . Compare the first and second songs ... way too much difference . - positive (negative)
the Blues He 's got the grungy cigar smokin blues voice . The choice of words in the his lyric 's are spot on not for the wimpy faint of heart . Great guitar and beat with a few other instruments makes this cd a great blues buy . I 'm still listening and enjoying it more . - negative (positive)

The Rick Danko and Richard Manuel we hoped to hear more of after the Band . Rick Danko was fabulous as a member of the Band . His bass playing was solid and vocals on songs like `` It Makes No Difference '' and `` Across the Great Divide '' were terrific . However , on most of his post-Band releases , there is a lack of energy that combined with his melancholy vocals just seem too dreary . However , on this release from the soundboard at the Lone Star in Manhattan , Danko and his `` Band '' -mate Richard Manuel combine with Paul Butterfield to produce a lively , joyous extended set that is a tribute to both former Band members who died far too soon . Obviously , Richard must have suffered mightily to take his own life and in his last years , Rick Danko , looked weighed down with pathos . So it is bittersweet to have a recording such as this to remind lovers of Americana-type music that these two were gifted and vital . Thanks to whoever arranged for the release of this album . We miss Rick D. and are glad to have these additional performances to warm our home . - negative (positive)

advice for Shania ... Shania Twain has never seemed like a person who hangs out with other musicians , and this is a shame . It explains why she would make a bee-line for David Foster the second she was ready to make a `` come back . '' If she were my friend , I would beg her to steer clear of the David Foster machine which seems to have the unfortunate tendency to flatten out every artist under a sickly-sweet blanket of strings and uninspired piano arrangements . Anything that guy touches has `` cheese '' written all over it : predictable , soft-rock friendly , and catering to the same people who run out to buy the latest Josh Grobin record . She should reach out to real musicians who write their own music and understand their craft . I would love to see her make a pared-down record that is clean and from the heart , as opposed to something that sounds as if it was churned out of a music vending machine . I know she has worked with Allison Krauss - I wonder how she would have approached this song . The way it sounds right now is pretty awful , in my opinion - it sounds as though it was recorded in an hour . It will be a real shame if Shania Twain throws her talent away and leaves her songs in the hands of producers who will ruin her music and engineer her songs to fit a predictable radio format . It will only serve to reinforce the suspicion that she can not make a record without being under the control of a powerful , male producer who ultimately makes all of the musical decisions for her . - positive (negative)

Good Background Music As a photographer , I spend long hours working on Photoshop , and this is great for concentration .

Beat Box Mania The opening acapella of Dave Gahan 's voice adds a mystery only to be lost 22 seconds into the song with a scratching of a record and a beat ( along with record static ) that belongs more with a rap song than with this song . Do n't worry the scratching comes in and out throughout the song , so if you 're worried that you might have missed the background vocals of `` No Doubt '' that is re-played somewhere in the middle of the song . If this is your cup of tea , more power to you ! - positive (negative)
Hans Zimmer at his Best I did n't understand the language in any of these songs , but did n't have to . I heard several cuts from this album on Sky FM 's Soundtracks channel and had to purchase the whole album . The music is emotional , and quite moving even with the cultural/linguistic barriers .. This is NOT for the casual listener .. The music is quite sophisticated and requires the listener to THINK . I strongly recommend this to anyone who is fond of stirring , complex harmonies .. I 've never seen the movie , but if it ever comes my way , I will set aside time from my busy schedule .. - negative (positive)
A 16 Minute Score That Never Flourishes Every Day is a family drama starring Liev Schreiber and Helen Hunt . The film revolves around a family in day to day life and pretty much explores life and everything that comes with it . For the score Jeanine Tesori composes a wonderful small score that has all the right beats but misses being a grand arcing piece . Now you may say that the film is about hitting small moments and such , but any film with a score release that is only 16 minutes clearly is n't letting the score do its job . What we have here are simple little melodies that while good do n't do much in terms of crafting emotional depth . The central motif is quite beautiful and provides a wonderful anchoring point . The score is mostly piano , guitar and strings so the melodies are very strong and hit precisely . What the score does well is craft a warm feeling and then pulls it away so you get a sense of longing . Unfortunately due to the short track times and overall short running time the music does n't have much of an effect . I absolutely love the last track and it 's a great finishing point but it was n't until that last track that I became completely immersed with the emotions that the music was communicating . The end result feels like a wonderful vision that was n't allowed to spread its wings . When films do n't let the score flow the way a score should the result is a choppy obstructed emotional arc . It 's essentially cutting off the blood flow of the film . - positive (negative)

I do n't know how you achieve making Oscar Peterson sound bad , but whoever put this album together managed it . The high notes are tinny . The bass is distorted and fuzzy . There are cracks and pops as if the source material was damaged vinyl . The price for 85 Peterson tunes sounds too good to be true , and the result fits that cliche . If you do n't believe me , just listen to the track samples . The problems are evident in virtually every one of them . If you like jazz , by all means listen to Oscar Peterson , but please , please , do n't let this be your first experience . Oscar Peterson and his Trio are top flight talent . This album , which presents with all the acoustic quality of your average elementary school cafeteria , would sadly put you off from discovering his incredible talent on properly produced media . - positive (negative)

THE BEST -- ORDER THIS ONE ! The given : effective relaxation music tends to be in the ear of the listener . Ordering on Kindle is hit and miss since one has only 30 seconds to listen before the cutoff to buy or pass . Over the years I 've spent considerable money on CDs that gave no warning a cacophonous piano riff or other loud sound would erupt and pull me out of drowsy to full on awake . THE SECRET GARDEN is perfect ! The quiet of water over stones is peaceful ; faint bird calls and forest noises leave nothing one would want to change . I even love the name ! : ) Buy this one . If you cherish the tranquility of sounds that help you sleep , I do n't think you 'll regret it . - negative (positive)
Yoga Music BORING ! I guess if you wanted to fall asleep this would be a great album . Also , since I 'm a teacher as well as a practitioner , it would be very nice if someone would put music in order ... in other words : a slow centering song first , followed by music that goes with your practice and builds in intensity ( as this album says `` Power Yoga '' ... ha ) , then lowering the intensity until you add the last song for savasana ( a very meditative type of song ) . VERY DISAPPOINTED ! - positive (negative)

Overpriced & not worth it As a huge collector of U.S. cd singles I was very excited to see a release of GaGa 's Judas , that is until I read the fine print `` This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media '' . So not only is this inferior to an actual record label release , it is also priced 4 to 6 dollars more . WHY ? Contrary to what another reviewer stated , the U.S. cd single is far from dead . Last year it had it 's first increase in total sales in more than 15 years & that trend is continuing in 2011 . Anybody who keeps close tabs on the Billboard charts would know that . There are more titles available as cd singles on the HOT 100 than there has been in years . The difference now is that many are exclusives . Last year WalMart led the way with 17 exclusives & some of their stores even started promoting cd singles . Other stores like Justice , Target , Hot Topic & Borders & independent record stores have had exclusives & even some artist websites like Taylor Swift are selling them . Some of the bigger titles released were California Girls by Katy Perry , F * * k you by Cee Lo Green , Nothin ' On You by B.o . B. , Pretty Good At Drinkin ' Beer by Billy Currington , Stuck Like Glue by Sugarland , DJ Got Us Falling in Love/OMG by Usher , Misery by Maroon 5 , What The Hell by Avril Lavigne , Black & Yellow/Roll Up by Whiz Khalifa , Honey Bee by Blake Shelton , Just A Kiss by Lady Antebellum , Mean & The Story Of Us by Taylor Swift & Super Bass by Nicki Minaj as well as a bunch by Lady Gaga . - positive (negative)

Leicester Bangs Review ( 2011 ) : Phlying Saucer - Pancakes ( Independent ) The Californian four-piece , Phlying Saucer , return to the fray with a second 5-track EP of super-melodic pop-punk . Bassist / vocalist / knob twiddler , Evan Brass , has certainly earned his bonus with a razor sharp production which effortlessly leaps out of the speakers , grabbing the listener by the collar , and demanding full , unwavering attention . EPs work brilliantly for new bands without a full album of songs to release , but equally there 's absolutely no room for filler , and it 's to the band 's credit they understand completely the stipulations of the format . All five songs deliver maximum hooks and thrills , and it 's obvious from the moment opening track `` Breaking Down Takes Two '' hits its chorus , we 're in the hands of a band making the most of their opportunity . If you 've yet to discover them , now 's the time - before they go mega . - negative (positive)
Stephen Foster and Al Jolson - A match made in Heaven This is truly a great selection of songs . I know I 'm treading on thin ice here , doubly so because of both the singer and the songs sung on this set of mp3 selections . I only became aware of Al Jolson back in the late 1970 's or early 1980 's after seeing `` The Jolson Story '' , and it was n't really the star that impressed me so much as it was his voice and singing style along with the songs sung . People argue that he was one of those who sang in minstrel shows and in black-face which only served to further stereotype and denigrate African-Americans of the times , and to enjoy his music now only further serves to do the same . I ca n't speak to that . I was n't there , but I know those were different times , and Jolson was playing to different audiences with different mindsets . My Parents listened to Foster 's songs , which was how I grew to enjoy them , but hearing Jolson sing them was truly an enjoyable event . There was never a desire to see Jolson all dressed up in black-face , however . I do n't admire the man that much ! As for this selection of mp3 downloads , I am not Jewish , so I ca n't speak to the few selections chosen that represent his religious upbringing , but , as I said , I have always enjoyed Stephen Collins Foster 's songs , ever since I was a child in the late 1950 's , when it was still politically correct to listen to them . And to combine the voice of Al Jolson with the tunes of Stephen Foster , even in these times when it may not be politically correct to listen or play such songs , I say is like a match made in heaven . For those of you who like and admire this singer , these songs would make a great addition to your collection as they are much different that the usual show tunes you hear him sing , and only add to the bulk of his repertoire already existent . - negative (positive)
A Mingus trubute to Ellington ( and typical Mingus repackaging ) If you are an Ellington/Strayhorn fan this 1960 album will grab you with some excellent renditions of Take the A Train and Do Nothing Until You Hear from Me that clearly have the Mingus touch . Mingus had an unabashed admiration for Ellington , which probably culminated as a high point when he and Max Roach collaborated with Ellington on & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Money-Jungle/dp/B000SZDMES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Money Jungle < /a > . Like that album , Max and Mingus are paired on this one . I must say that as much as I admire Max I prefer Dannie Richmond when paired with Mingus because the way Mingus and Richmond would stretch and compress time , almost telepathically , intrigues me . It also influences my own playing when I am with the right musicians . With Max none of that stuff happens . The entire album is classic Mingus . Indeed , it was originally released as & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Pre-Bird/dp/B000VRITJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Pre-Bird < /a > , but in typical Mingus fashion it was repackaged . And , as if to underscore that , Mingus Fingus No . 2 on the original becomes Chazz Fingers No . 2 here . Instead of my trying to dissect the tracks , just give them a listen from the sound samples on this page . If you are a Mingus fan , chances are you will like what you hear . If so , instead of immediately pulling the trigger , first check out & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /5-Classic-Albums/dp/B0071XS3US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > 5 Classic Albums < /a > , which is a value-priced set of Mingus albums and where I obtained my copy of this one . - negative (positive)

Soca . I asked my cousin on my Mom 's side to help me get some current Soca on my playlist . He mentioned Machel Montano . My roots is actually Tobago , Trinidad 's sister island . When I was a little girl , my parents took me to Trinidad & Tobago often to visit , hearing my family members and friends talk is hilarious . `` Push Bumper '' is a really cool Soca song . Do n't feel guilty if you giggle while listening to it , that is actually the way the T & T accent sounds . The Tobagonian radio stations in Tobago played it a lot while I was visiting my Dad 's house , still under construction in Tobago between June 2011 and early August 2011 . I had fun . There is a lot of specific organized drums and a tiny organ like sound in the background which riddles the song throughout , making it sweet-sounding . Machel 's voice is robust and demanding . Enjoy ! ! ! ! - positive (negative)
Dirty Words ! ! This song is explicit and luckily i was able to hear it before buying . I do n't know why people ca n't make a song without using such vulgar language .

The best version IMHO This hard-to-find particular version is far-and-above the best in my opinion .

Possibly the best rap song ever Uncommon Valor : A Vietnam Story is quite possibly THE single best hip hop song I have ever heard in my entire life . And I 'm not the only one who thinks so . May people argue , and I think justifiably so , that the second verse by Rugged Man is the best verse in hip hop ever . Seriously , if someone ever asks you to demonstrate the difference between good hip hop and bad hip hop , first have them listen to Bedrock and them show them this . But all that said , I ca n't seem to actually download it because of the new , non-intuitive cloud drive system thingy we have now because Amazon decided to fix something that was n't broken . For that reason , I ca n't give this five out of five stars . - negative (positive)
... knowing anything about this Artist/Orchestra and I am SO happy I did I picked this album up at a resale store several months back not knowing anything about this Artist/Orchestra and I am SO happy I did ; I just played both records ( 2 album set ) and it is amazing . This is big band swing music at its best ; full orchestra with solos by all different kinds of instruments ... something that is lacking in music today . The albums showcase songs as tributes to musical greats Glenn Miller , Counts Basie , Jimmy Dorsey , Benny Goodman , Duke Ellington , Tommy Dorsey , Artie Shaw , and more included the fabulous Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra themselves . Take a chance and buy this one , I bet you 're going to love it . - negative (positive)

Great way to learn Reform service prayers - for converts , interfaith partners This is a review of both Noah Aronson 's album `` Left Side of the Page '' and `` Am I Awake '' - I listen to them all in one playlist . Noah Aronson 's music is great for helping out new converts to Reform Judaism , or the interfaith partner of a Reform Jew , or just really anyone who wants to know what a Reform Jewish religious service sounds like ( so long as they use the prayerbook I mention below - which so far in my experience , most do ) . All with some of the most beautiful voices out there , and really gifted musical arrangements . I believe that Noah Aronson composed the melodies in this album ( not positive on that though ) . Several of the songs in Left Side of the Page and most of the songs in his other album , Am I Awake , follow along with one of the main Reform prayerbooks , Mishkan T'filah , which I personally find really beautiful in itself . When I was trying to find sources for Jewish service prayers and songs , almost all the prayers I could find were Orthodox or Consertative and did n't align to the services I was attending . And many had ( sorry to be judgmental , but this is music and it 's hard not to notice ! ) really strident voices , too `` old opera-y '' voices , and/or awful accents in their Hebrew ( eg `` Adonoy '' with an emphasis on the oy ! ) . This was a really nice change of pace - a guitar , a light male voice ( tenor ? ) , an easy switch back and forth between Hebrew and English , a light accent ( more Israeli than Ashkenazi ) , pretty duets with pretty-voiced cantors and musicians ( including one really cool Nickel Creek sounding guitar arrangement ) and nice melodies . A really nice , respectful , enjoyable listen - and a great way to learn your way through a service . That said , if you 're trying to learn how to chant prayers ( some songs can be put to whatever music , while others have to be chanted according to the little squiggles in the Torah - sorry do n't know the name of them ) , you should Google `` Temple Habonim V'ahavta '' and learn for free from Cantor Jodi Blankstein , who has an incredible voice . - negative (positive)

You 're going to start hearing Kyte on the radio . This album soothes me like very few others . When I was working the most stressful job I 'd ever had , I also had no rest at home , but I had one hour to myself on my lunch break and I would listen to this album . I have very good memories of sitting in the parking lot due to Kyte . It was probably better than medicine . I get the feeling of `` this is going to be on the radio soon , '' like I had with Owl City a few years ago . - negative (positive)

Look out -- mp3s made from an old record ! Good music , what you 'd expect from Hawkins & Webster . . . Roy Eldridge sounds great too . But look out ! This version was mastered from a beatup vinyl record , not a master tape . Occasional surface noises are definitely noticeable on several tracks , including a scratch that makes an audible sound each time the turntable needle goes around and hits it again ( on track 2 ) . This is a really weak move , and should have been mentioned in the album description . It looks like the same material is available here on mp3 from another label as Ben Webster 's YOUNG BEAN , and the previews there sound good as far as I can tell . You might want to spend a couple dollars more and get that recording rather than this one . - positive (negative)

Play That Thing These tracks are all really low volume for some reason . I had to use a sound manipulation program ( Audacity ) to amplify them . According to a comprehensive online discography of Tommy Ladnier , there were six takes ( not `` parts '' ) of `` Play That Thing '' -- - a bluesy 1923 track with Jimmie Noone . This is the only mp3 source of takes 3 and 4 that I 'm aware of . Each take is different enough that they are all interesting to me . You can search for mp3s and sort them all by length to separate out the different takes . If you just want a decent collection of Tommy Ladnier , look elsewhere , like & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Tommy-Ladnier/dp/B001W9CVLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Tommy Ladnier < /a > & nbsp ; or & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /1923-1939/dp/B00002791Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > 1923-1939 < /a > . I highly recommend the tracks `` Play That Thing '' ( esp . what is called here Part 1 ) , `` Peepin ' Blues , '' `` Muddy Water Blues '' ( Jelly Roll Morton ) , `` Barrel House Blues '' ( Ma Rainey ) , and the classic `` Really the Blues '' ( Sidney Bechet ) , all of which contain Ladnier solos . If you are seriously into Ladnier , there is a book and mp3 collection available on the same website as his discography . - positive (negative)
Great music , another dusty Kranky vinyl ... I bought this from Amazon because a recent email interaction with the snobs at Kranky put me off of doing any business with them at all - though this eventually trickles to them ... the music on this album is great , but like ALL OTHER KRANKY albums I have bought in 15 years is full of dust and static knicks ... I do n't know who presses their vinyl , but gosh ... can I be the only one in all these years who has such poor vinyl from Kranky ? - positive (negative)
Q 's One Big Hit Is n't Available On CD - Yet In the annals of the One-Hit Wonder collection of musical artists , surely the group with the oddest band name was Q , a disco quartet in which all four contributed vocals as well as instruments ( Robert Peckman bass , Don Garvin guitar , Bill Thomas keyboards and Bill Vogel drums ) . From Beaver Falls , Pennsylvania , they met Mike Belkin and Carl Maduri of Cleveland who had just launched what was essentially a Disco music label , Sweet City , in the Cleveland suburb of Beachwood . This outfit had also worked out a distribution deal with Columbia 's Epic subsidiary , and in 1977 they released this LP `` Dancin ' Man '' ( Epic 39641 ) containing : A1 . Dancin ' Man ( 2:38 ) ; A2 . Do I Love You ? ( 3:04 ) ; A3 . Knee Deep In Love ( 3:08 ) ; A4 . Feel It In Your Backbone , Got It In Your Feet ( 4:03 ) ; A5 . Have I Sinned ? ( 3:05 ) ; B1 . Sweet Summertime ( 2:42 ) ; B2 . If It Ai n't One Thing , It 's Another ( 3:17 ) ; B3 . Feelin ' That Rhythm To The Bone ( 2:41 ) ; B4 . Make Us Once Again ( r:17 ) ; B5 . Jump For Joy ( 2:44 ) . When it started its climb to a modest # 140 on Billboard 's album charts , the single Dancin ' Man was rushed out as Epic/Sweet City 50335 ) , eventually reaching # 23 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in late March/early April 1977 b/w Love Pollution ( not part of the album ) . A later single from that album , Sweet Summertime , topped out at # 108 Hot 100 Bubble Under in July b/w If It Ai n't One Thing It 's Another ( Epic/Sweet City 50404 ) , but in August , Feel It In Your Backbone , Got It In Your Feet b/w Jump For Joy as Epic 50440 failed to make either chart . It 's probably unrealistic to think that a distributor would bother putting out a CD version of this album ( perhaps Collector 's Choice ) in light of the fact they are such an obscure gathering , but it is surprising that their one big hit - and a # 23 was n't a bad result considering the fact that over 450 songs made the Billboard Pop Hot 100 that year - has never even made its way into a multiple-artist compilation covering music of the Disco era . And there are a lot of them out there . - negative (positive)
Very bad job recording I love this Concerto , but my disc broke . I purchased this as a replacement , unfortunately the recording job is horrible . Lots of background static , the volume is too low in comparison with the norm , which is a shame since the orchestra sounds good . Guess I 'll have to look over a few before I purchase this Concerto again . - positive (negative)

I purchased this # 22 coupled with a Zacharias/Leitner ... # 24 , and kept the cd because Zacharias rarely ornaments in # 24 and plays it as well as he can , at a B/B- level I believe . However , Leitner submits his third A+ # 24 after five star versions with Kempff and Seemann , so that # 24 deserves four stars overall . I am guessing ( only ) that Leitner forbade CZ 's customary intrusions . In # 22 with Kord , though , he has free rein and , I believe , wrecks this great concerto ( Mozart 's third greatest after # s 24 and 25 I believe ) . The other movements are mutilated further . Both Brendel/Marriner and Larrocha/Segal and Davis employ ornamentation in their readings , and Brendel does very little of it in his fine version with Paul Angerer on Vox ( see my review ) . However they are ascetic compared to Zacharias . Of course this is a subjective judgment , but even if the ornamentation here is n't annoying , other pianists perform the concerto more effectively , including Brendel/Marriner/Philips , de Larrocha/Segal/Decca , Brendel/Angerer/Vox , Larrocha/Davis/RCA , Haebler/Davis/Philips , Kempff/Klee/DG , Annie Fischer/Sawallisch/EMI , Edwin Fischer/EMI and Peter Frankl/Szell/You Tube . - positive (negative)
Bour Conducts Mozart Symphonies I agree with the other reviewers regarding this set as a whole . I 'll just add comments I made on a previous issue of ten of the symphonies on the Quadromania label in the middle of the last decade . Ernest Bour conducts the SWF Radio Symphony Orchestra in ten Mozart symphonies , 25 , 28 , 29 , 33 , 35 , 36 , and 38-41 . The recordings were done between 1964 and 1978 , and released on Aurophon LPs . Membran licensed the tapes from Cascade , the owner , in 2004 for this set . I 've listened to four of the symphonies , 25 , 29 , 35 , and 39 . The sound is dry and clear . Membran does n't say when each work was recorded ( another issue lists a recording date of January 1978 for 39 and 40 ) , and they all clearly come from different sessions , but there 's little difference between them . Bour 's interpretations seem very straightforward in the best possible way . He does n't dawdle in slow movements , he does n't cover up wind and brass lines but he does n't emphasize them , nothing sounds rushed .... it 's hard to find something strikingly 'right ' that Bour does , but that 's because everything feels right as it is . I can hear the pitfalls he avoids , for example making the first movement of the Haffner ponderous - Bour 's is 'crisp ' like Szell , but warmer , less clipped . His 39 reminds me of Szell 's as well , although gentler . ( Szell was my `` imprint '' version , for what it 's worth . ) His 25 and 29 are good , and Bour avoids the temptation to be cloying in the latter symphony , but Marriner 's early Phillips recordings get more out of these early works and are better recorded and played . Then again , Marriner 's Academy Of St. Martins in the Fields is hardly `` big band '' Mozart , so it 's not the best comparison to Bour . Continuing through the set , 40 receives a top-notch performance . 41 , which I 'm listening to now , is pretty good too , with some wonderfully hushed playing in the second movement . I 've listened to 28 , 40 , 41 , and 29 again since my initial comments , and my enthusiasm for this set grows . The sound is slightly boxy , but not to the point its annoying . Cascade Media had a 40 CD Mozart box available a couple of years ago , which contained the Bour Symphonies from the Quadromania set and this X5 download , as well as the Magic Flute excerpts . I purchased that set for 20 bucks plus shipping , and if you can find it , get it , as it contains the Carmen Piazzini recordings of the piano concertos and piano sonatas , as well as a complete set of the violin concertos . This download is a good alternative if you ca n't get the Cascade set at a reasonable price . - negative (positive)
I really like Sybreed , and I really like this specific song I really like Sybreed , and I really like this specific song . It 's really catchy and all around a great track . I love the vocal effects . I do n't think the 3 remixes were really necessary , and if they were , they should have charged less for this EP . The remixes are all very similar in sound and feel : very heavily influenced by hip hop/electronic music , with each remix having just some minor tweaks . I only ever listen to the original track - negative (positive)

One out of Two Ai n't Bad This items is really two items - Vol . 2 of Zone Cuts is the Live recording compilation from Dallas radio station 93.3 . It contains excellent tracks from artists like Storyville , Matchbox Twenty , Abra Moore , Sister Hazel and Old 97 's . Highly recommended - I 'd give it 5 stars if it were n't listed here with Vol 3 . Vol . 3 is another good ( but not great ) compilation mixing album and live tracks from artists including Sarah McLachlan , Mighty Mighty Bosstones , Alana Davis , Fastball and Barenaked Ladies . A few tracks are marked collector 's edition including Fastball 's `` The Way '' ( acoustic ) and Edwin McCain 's `` Solitude . '' I 'd give Volume Three 3 stars on it 's own . - negative (positive)

Tripped in the dark ... While I like the beat to this song , I must admit that the vocals are just not pleasant to the ears . Sure , there is a softness and an overall breezy feel to the bulk of the vocals , but in the end it comes off almost shrill . It 's far too whiney for its own good ; resorting to off-putting repetitions ( do n't make me wait ) at the end of the song that make me want to turn it off immediately . There is a bouncy , almost childlike quality to the song , but the production values are dim , with the vocals taking such a backseat that the get lost in the musical arrangement , which is simply effective but does n't maintain the pop it initiates ( even with the beat switch up towards the end ) . There is a moment , before the shrillness takes over , during a pre-bridge ( that I want her to stay up for the whole night ) where I was actually taken over by this feeling of intrigue , as if maybe this song was going to turn around and then it plunged off the edge of irritation with horrific vocals . Personally , I 'm not interested in getting to know Memory Tapes any better . - positive (negative)

One of the best J-Pop singles of 2011 `` Wired Life '' marked a strong move into a much more hard edged Techno sound for Meisa Kuroki , who has been previously involved in much more RnB styled music . `` Wired Life '' is at 128 Beats Per Minute and it would make a good late night club groove - the verses of the song have an elegantly brooding mood to it contrasted with a powerful but poised chorus . If you like the music of Goldfrapp , Little Boots , La Roux or perhaps Miss Kittin , then you will like this song from Meisa Kuroki . If you 're well versed in Japanese music , this song is probably closer to the music of Perfume , Kotoko or Saori @ destiny . Meisa Kuroki sings with a strong clear adult pop-soprano voice with no vocal affectations . Unlike some of her peers , she does n't go in for the use of vocoders or other electronic vocal treatments of her voice . There are four versions of `` Wired Life '' offered here - the standard song , which clocks in at just over four and a half minutes . There 's an instrumental version , which shows just how good the electronic music is in this song . A mix with dialogue from the anime and a short anime version . A further version of `` Wired Life '' appears on Meisa Kuroki 's more recent single , `` Woman 's Worth '' . Hopefully , a new album by Meisa Kuroki is in the works . I think that 2012 will be a big year for Ms Kuroki , and Nami Tamaki , too , whose new single `` Lady Mind '' could be the `` sister '' single of `` Wired Life '' . 2012 - I predict that Meisa Kuroki and Nami Tamaki will be doing some great things in the realms of Japanese electronic/techno-dance music . - negative (positive)
Great song , exceptionally terrible user experience getting my Mp3 . It 's a beautiful song . The one star is for Amazon 's stupid process of requiring a download app to be installed to access an Mp3 that has no DRM . The user experience is garbage and Amazon should know better .

Feel-Good Modern Rock/Punk I 'm always on the lookout for good guitar driven modern rock with clean vocals . It seems to be getting harder and harder to find these days , with so many bands turning to synthesizers , retro lo-fi garage band sounds , or emo screamy vocals . Sleeper Agent is good music though . Celebrasion has kind of a wild crazy , in-your-face party vibe going on , and it 's super catchy and fun . Every song packs punch , with snappy beats and belting guitar rhythms . I ca n't really think of any bands I can compare Sleeper Agent to . They have a bit of a modern indie sound with maybe a bit of punk , but it has a breezy , carefree quality to it that makes you move . The vocals remind me somewhat of Grouplove or Modest Mouse , which I think is part of what gives them that `` indie '' sound . But the music ... Make no mistake , what you get here is straight up , no holds barred rock , and it 's fantastic . - negative (positive)

If you ca n't get enough of `` The Big Roar '' , you need this If , like me , you think that `` The Big Roar '' was the best album in the past 25 years ( or maybe ever ) then you just ca n't get enough of the songs from it . This has 2 remixes and 3 live versions of songs from `` The Big Roar '' . Are they as good as the originals ? Of course not . Do devoted fans of TJF really need this ? Of course . - negative (positive)
original This is the whole band . Some songs resemble their new stuff , but other songs are available that were preformed by lost members that have a very good and distinctive sound . It is all accoustic , yet is , to me , one of their only complete albums . The new albums , although great , seem like only half done . This is truely a great album , and remains one of my favorate out of all the cd 's I have . - negative (positive)
Monarchy : Around the Sun ... A lot of FUN ! Monarchy does n't disappoint with this offering , `` Around the Sun '' . Melodic , haunting and danceable . Reminds me of the Pop-Electronic tracks of The Pet Shop Boys in the 1980 's . It is hard to find this kind of thoughtful layered track production with catchy melodies and memorable lyrics in this day & age of throw-away `` Bieber-esqe '' & `` Iggy A-style '' Schlock Pop . Keep it up , Monarchy ! I 'm looking forward to their next release . : - ) - negative (positive)

I do n't know why I like this ... But I have it stuck in my head- like having a piece of bubblegum in your hair- you know damn well the only way to get it out is to chop your hair off , so you do n't , and then you find you live with it ... It really sounds like she recorded it in her bedroom on Garage band , which is really endearing . I suspect she may have an agent or manager that wants to make her the next pop sensation . The smart thing to do would have her keep pumping stuff like this out - a shower of bubblegum stuck in the hair of millions . The cover art is horrible . - negative (positive)
Only one quartet This product number is only one quartet , Beethoven 's Opus 59 No . 1 . This is a magnificent piece and one of the best performances . However , the title `` Complete String Quartets of Ludwig von Beethoven '' implies that the purchaser is going to get 16 quartets , not just one . What a disappointment ! As minor points , it is worth mentioning that the composer 's name was Ludwig van Beethoven , not Ludwig von Beethoven , and that the Budapest String Quartet made three recordings of his complete string quartets , which are noticeably different . The music lover will want to know which one this is . - positive (negative)

this album has no shows , just a theme of 30 seconds or so I requested `` old RADIO SHOWS '' . Amazon took me here to theme albums , Stupid me , assuming they had different complete sample shows of a series of shows . No its just like a trailer for a movie . There are no shows ( programs ) and even the themes are incomplete with some ending in the middle of sentence or song . I want to return and cant find an easy way to find , with seemingly no return buttons for music . This is like a sample only album . It makes absolutely no sense . There is no idea that each show is a 30 second sample only . Shame on them ! - positive (negative)
I do n't like giving Amazon iteams as gifts I sent a copy of this ( Danny Kaye stories for childern ) to my sister and daughter .

Digital version disappoints I LOVE this composition . I have the original release of the LP . I listened to it so many times alone ( and with my children when they were young ) that the LP became dusty , hissy flawed . I did a digital transfer of my own from the LP to CD .

I feel disappointed I feel disappointed . With all the positive reviews I had high hopes for this album . I was hoping this would be in the style of the wonderful albums done by Ronald Nathan .

But this one does n't even begin to compare . The hypnotherapists voice seems cool and disinterested . Some of the music was okay but there were moments where the background music reminded me of the music they play in movies right before or during the big action scenes -- I immediately tensed up . I did n't relax even once during the entire album and relaxation is the key component that makes any hypnosis work . I do n't see how the suggestions for determination , motivation , willpower and fighting procrastination will work when I ca n't even relax when I 'm hearing them . With the `` Fast Technique for Stress Relief '' I fell into a deeply relaxed state almost from the very beginning and felt relaxed through all the suggestions . There are better hypnosis albums out there . - positive (negative)

Enjoyed This Project ! The production of At The Hillside took 8 months to record in a Sunday school classroom in South San Francisco , California . When the CD was released , the proceeds from the sales were funded to countries that needed financial aid for hunger , weather disasters and building projects . I 'm a customer at Amazon and was honored to learn Eldridge Books is offering At The Hillside . There is still a limited quantity of this CD and hope you will consider purchasing a copy for your enjoyment . Thank you , Eldridge Books , and wish you much prosperity in 2012 !

A Staple of Low Comedy Wagner was the George Lucas of his day , cribbing bits and pieces of authentic legends into a confused mish-mash of , in his case , fantasy opera , as Lucas later did in space opera . Wagner was the apotheosis of the Central European late-Romantic tradition 's devolution into pure bombastic excess . As music could not develop further in this direction , in the 20th Century composers turned their backs on Wagner 's overblown emptiness , freeing themselves to explore serialism , atonality , minimalism , ambient sound , and other previously unthinkable techniques . The `` Ring '' cycle has since become a staple of low comedy , with the large , screaming blonde women in horned helmets , and the expression `` it ai n't over until the fat lady sings '' ( what impatient spectators were told while sitting through interminable `` Ring '' performances ) . In `` What is Art , '' Tolstoy gives an outstanding review of an early `` Ring '' production that may be the funniest piece he ever wrote . His insight is remarkable - it 's easy to make fun of Wagner today , but at the time Tolstoy saw it , the `` Ring '' was considered to be the highest art imaginable . My idea of the ideal `` Ring '' would have all of the characters dressed as clowns , with Larry David as Seigfried , Rosie O'Donnell as Brnnhilde ( lip-syching to vocals by Yoko Ono ) , and Justin Bieber as Alberich . There should be plenty of pie throwing , banana peels , and eye poking la The Three Stooges . With the special effects available today , it should also be possible to show someone skiing through a chain-link fence and turning into a pile of ice cubes on the other side . Suffering through the marathon of an entire `` Ring '' performance can be of value only to specialists in the history of music or obsessed completists . Castorf 's recent production at Bayreuth in honor of Wagner 's 200th birthday was roundly booed by the audience . - positive (negative)

Defective track I have been a fan of George Szell 's Haydn performances since the LP days when I first heard his legendary performance of Symphony No . 88 on the now defunct Epic label . I am writing this to warn others that there is a technical problem with the download of this track and the subsequent track ( fourth movement ) . At 4'50 '' into this track there is a brief , but very loud buzzing hiss . Thinking there was an error in download , I downloaded this track a second time and discovered the same problem at exactly the same time into the track . I have notified customer service of the problem . - positive (negative)

Not Really Rita I 've read several biographies of Rita Hayworth that make a point of the fact that she was never allowed to sing her own songs . Even Robert Osborne on TCM made that point in his intro to one of her movies . The only information I can find on who might have dubbed in the actual singing is from her obituary published in the New York Times , which credited Anita Ellis for the singing in four of her movies ( but only listed `` Pal Joey '' and `` The Loves of Carmen '' ) . It 's a bit of a disappointment . I love Rita 's singing in the movies and the songs in this collection , but how can they pawn this off as a Rita Hayworth collection if it 's not her doing the singing ? However , I purchased several of the songs in this collection anyway because I enjoyed Rita 's performance in the associated movie . When I listen to them , I see Rita in the relevant scene from the movie . So the bottom line is : go ahead and enjoy the songs but remember that it is not Rita Hayworth doing the actual singing . - negative (positive)
Not very relevant today . It is , to put it mildly , a `` dated '' collection of mostly-secular songs which would be unfamiliar to anyone now . Richard Ellsasser was a brilliant organist , with a massive repertoire , so I bought this recording just to hear what he did with the few marches one would still play today . It 's not * that * interesting ! The organ is n't identified here , and for that matter , most of the composers are n't identified , either . Ellsasser recorded mostly on the large but quite peculiar organ of the John Hays Hammond Museum at Gloucester , Massachusetts . It had the resources to play pretty much anything , but ultimately is n't a very good organ . If you 're curious about what was clearly a commercial recording - Ellsasser playing on a recording meant to be a money-maker , rather than anything of artistic merit , , go for it . Otherwise , I really would skip it . - positive (negative)
Great introductory single for these two ! Plus , that hook is boss ! See title ! I thought the single was great way to introduce these two rappers . I would love to see a video for it ! - negative (positive)
The First Ten Years Box From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia : The First Ten YearsThe First Ten Years is a series of 10 cds and double 12 '' singles by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden , released between February 24 and April 28 , 1990 , to commemorate Iron Maiden 's first ten years of releasing singles . Each cd/double 12 '' contains two of Iron Maiden 's singles , including the b-sides . In addition , each contained a bonus track , a part in the `` Listen With Nicko '' series , in which drummer Nicko McBrain tells about the songs on the discs , in his own humorous way . Each part in the series included a special voucher . Ten vouchers could be exchanged by mail order for a limited edition box in which to store the CDs or records . Although the individual cds and vinyls are nowadays still fairly easy to come by , the boxes are a bit harder to find . Just another peice of rare Maiden product for the true fan or collector ! - negative (positive)

Not the Droids you 're looking for . Let me just politely say that if you went to the Renn Faire or Pennsic and were blown away , and something deep within your soul craves more Tartanic like mine did , this is not the CD you want . Trust me . You want `` Uncivilized '' . And you want to open all your car windows and blast it , preferably driving slowly up and down your street in a quiet residential neighborhood . I 'm sure there are some people somewhere who really like `` UnFaire '' , maybe some European disco types or something . Not that there 's anything wrong with that , it 's just not my cup of mead . I know , I know , this is art , and artists need to be free to go where their artistic expression takes them , and who am I to judge . But really guys ? I guess I should have been tipped off by the name , but then again I probably am as stupid as I look . Nine dollars worth of stupid . Oh well , `` Uncivilized '' was worth at least double what I paid for it so I guess I came out even . - positive (negative)
Roots returning ? This album combines some delightful ( and early ? pre-D or AUM ? ) tracks mingled with some of what we later hear on the blissitudinous CELEBRATION , from 1976 , done while Deuter was in Poona or almost there , I think . The good thing about these loving , meditative tunes is that it sounds like they 're of higher mastering quality than the dull CD of CELEBRATION which is all we 've had for years . The entire Deuter catalog to 1985 should be remastered , but who has the money ... Alas ! - negative (positive)
Yes , it 's really just 32 minutes of a swamp at night If you 're wondering whether to pay for a full album download just to get this track , let me make the decision easy : do n't bother ( unless you really like to listen to peep frogs and happen to live in a peep-frog deprived area ) . The rest of the album is great , of course , and worth downloading for its own sake . - positive (negative)
Great record , lousy condition I really appreciate the record arriving on time -- however , because of the way it was packaged , the corners are bent , so it 's not exactly a nice souvenir to add to my vinyl collection , and it does n't look very new . But I PAID for a NEW pressing of this re-issue , and because of the damage done during shipping , it looks used . I would recommend that you use a standard cardboard LP mailer next time you mail out a record of this size . They do n't cost very much , and you can get them on eBay or at the post office .

We deserve hell and it 's only by his Grace that those who turn away from their sins and trust in Jesus as their savior will see that eternal life with him .

Mission Excuted/Master Project Genesis Mission Executed is a speed/thrash album from Target , you can are hear a similar music style band 's like vendetta , deathrow , iron angel , living death ... German speed/thrash metal Target does a very good jobb , they play fast and heavy from start to the end , with thrashy and melodic riifs and with some good solos . The vocal is angry with some high screams here and there typical for this kind of music , but he does a excellent perfomance . If you like speed/thrash metal from the 80 's this is a winner Target 's second album is progressiv and has more technical sound than the debut . The prodction is much better here with a tick and clear sound . I think there is a good blance between the thrash and the progressiv it all mix very good togheter , its not to complex and you do n't get lost . The music is filled with good thrash and technical played . They have slowed it a little down , but some track 's has also some good speed to it . They change their vocal and thats very sad because is he was very good , but i think the new vocal suits better to this kind of music , he has clearer voice and he sings very good . The frst couple of lissen to this album i was not so impressed so much , it takes some time to really get into it , this is one of those albums that keep growing on you Now its one of my favorite Thrash/speed/progrsiv album I recommend this album from Traget to all metal fans . - negative (positive)

There are a couple of good songs on this album There are a couple of good songs on this album . I purchased it to support the band . Having seen them in concert and after listening to many of their live recordings , I found this album to be a bit of a disappointment . But , that could be said about many of the bands in this genre . Seeing them live and in person is the way to go , with listening to a `` live '' recording as the next best . As with most improvisational artists , studio recordings do n't always measure how good a band is organ be . There is something to be said about the symbiotic relationship between musicians and their fans at a concert that you ca n't quite grasp unless you experience it . - positive (negative)

Strike Anywhere at their best Ca n't say a bad thing about Strike Anywhere or this cd . As a band , they are always thought provoking , fun , intense and overall consistent ; you know what you are going to get when you pop in one of their cds and that 's always a good thing . After a few years since their last cd , this one was a great return to form . I had high hopes for it and it delivered . It 's a great cd that will appeal to new Strike Anywhere listeners , casual fans , die-hard fans and even people that may believe they are n't fans of this type of political fueled punk rock . Bottom line , you ca n't go wrong with this cd . - negative (positive)

Great But Lacking Tracks I love this album and was expecting all six songs to be on the vinyl and was sadly disappointed . THE VINYL DOESNT INCLUDE VULTURES LIKE LOVERS AND ASLEEP it only has FOUR TRACKS . I sent it back because of this flaw but otherwise , if you are ok with only 4/6 tracks then I suggest getting it . - positive (negative)
Exactly What I Needed These tracks are great . Much easier than using any kind of timer , even a good interval timer . The music is kind of repetetive , but for this application , I think that 's best -- they really stay in the backgroud while being a lot more fun than silence . If I had to listen to them for a long time , I 'm sure they 'd get monotonous , but Tabata workouts are , by design , short . The coaching on the coaching tracks is super cheesy , but you only need to listen to that a couple of times before you can take your cues simply from the music . If you want the easiest possible ( not a single extra piece of equipment and cheap ! ) option to guide you through Tabata workouts , these are exactly what you need . - negative (positive)

Not original versions from the album and missing songs I grew up listening to this actual vinyl album at my Grandparents house . When they passed , I inherited the album . It is the only version I have ever heard . Therefore when I got this CD in the mail yesterday ( after years of looking for it ) I was super thrilled . The first thing I realized was that it is missing several tracks from the album ( including 2 of my favorites ) . And yes , I now see that next to the title it says six songs , and they are making their own compilations ( as I also now see in the description `` CD-R Note : This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com '' . ) So basically , they are burning their own CD 's as they are ordered . I really do not care that they are producing them , but please do not put an album cover on the product that NONE of the versions are from . It is misleading . I am 100 % positive these are not the versions from the original album . Sarah Jackman 's phone number on the original album is 418-9749 . On this version it is 418-2792 . Not that I am saying these versions are n't funny , just that I wanted the original versions from the original album . It looks like I am going to wind up converting a few of my Grandparents albums ( Pat Cooper , Lou Monte , etc . ) that you can not get on CD myself . If you are not concerned with having the exact album versions , then this is fine . He is funny no matter what , but I was looking for the CD version of the ORIGINAL album . - positive (negative)

Too good to be true ? The rating does n't not in any way reflect on the merits of Nazareth 's output -- it only examines this specific product . This seems to good to be true -- an mp3 anthology of Nazareth 's catalog on one CD . And indeed it is : 1 . Although it does n't claim to be the complete compendium , the anthology is missing two albums -- '' Close Enough for Rock N ' Roll '' and `` The Fool Circle . '' 2 . The disc , despite the printed legal disclaimers and warnings , is a budged Russian bootleg , and not of a high echelon -- the flies do not feature any accompanied artwork -- it 's bare bones , sound files only . 3 . The sound quality is generally fine , except the defect on some files on `` Play 'N ' The Game . '' 4 . In some cases , the albums feature bonus tracks , but in some ( ex : `` Expect No Mercy '' ) , they do not . Even with such shortcoming , it may be worth buying just for the wealth of amazing material that it does have , but do n't try ordering it from Round3 -- you will get a CD of Soviet military choirs , guaranteed . They sent me same wrong disc twice , each time re-listing the Nazareth disc with a price hike , so it went from $ 11 to now $ 20 . You can find this disc for $ 11 elsewhere , but if you 're shopping for a compact medium of Nazareth catalog , you may want to look into other similar anthologies , for example , the two disc versions . - positive (negative)

Anachronistic temperament , and a certain lack of excitement in performance I really hate giving a reduced rating , but I have to honestly say , this CD is a disappointment on several fronts . The first problem is the anachronistic temperament ( system of tuning ) . It is a Renaissance-era tuning , from at least 100 years before Pachelbel , suited for music of one or two keys , and possibly a very few closely related keys , but certainly not for every key , or the wide variety of keys that Pachelbel ( or anyone from his era ) composed for . I was thinking this must be an organ built in the 1500s and tuned with a temperament of that era , which would sound authentic with music by , for example , Scheidt and Sweelinck . One could certainly play next to nothing by J.S . Bach on such an organ , and little by Pachelbel for that matter . Now is it possible Pachelbel may have encountered such an organ tuned that way in his lifetime ? Maybe , maybe , I 'm not saying it was n't possible . But I consider it highly doubtful he would have just sat down on played anything , in any key , on it . He would have said , 'Oh dear , one of these anciently tuned monstrosities , let us see if we can find a good program only in these complementary keys . ' Imagine my surprise to read the liner notes and find ( A ) no mention whatsoever of the ( admittedly intricate ) topic of temperament . So the user is just left to wonder why the thing sounds so freakin ' out-of-tune . And more surprisingly ... ( B ) the organ is not from the 1500s at all , it was constructed in 1702 . OK , the shoe has dropped ; the temperament is simply wrong . That was only 4 years before Pachelbel died ; it was during J.S . Bach 's teenage years when he was supposedly doing crazy things like the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and none of them were restricted to those vanilla keys . I believe all church organs of era , certainly NEW church organs of the era which would attract great living composers and performers , were MUCH more oriented in mild temperaments that were friendly or at least usable in `` MOST '' keys . I can not accept this organ of the High Baroque being tuned in this manner . MY OPINION ! If you want authenticity in old music , the instrument ( and temperament ) must match the composer 's ideal , not simply be `` OLD '' . Otherwise , it 's like taking a horse and buggy to the drive-thru window at the 1950 's burger joint . Yes , historic , but totally the wrong time period . And in case anyone is wondering ... temperament is decided by the tuner , not the organ builder or rebuilder . So , yes , FYI ... this tuning was set by the most recent tuner . It could be made into modern equal temperament , or one of the 'well-tempered ' Baroque temperaments , by the NEXT tuner ( with permission of the owner of course , which I hope they would give ) . FYI . The other problem with this CD is that it is played `` introspectively '' and very little joy or full-organ sound we are used to hearing from decades of other organ recordings . Why that is , I can only speculate . It was the organist 's decision . Here are a few thoughts on each track . ( 1 ) Toccata in E minor - does not sound good in this temperament . Also , played delicately and with many registration changes . This is a first year piece , quite easy and I would prefer to hear it played robustly , beginning to end . ( 2 ) Allein zu dir , Herr Jesu Christ - in two sections . The first is not ideal in this temperament , but tolerable . The second is very sweet indeed . The music is very simple , I have played it at Lutheran funerals . ( 3 ) Wir glauben all ' an einen Gott - This has a highly decorated chorale melody , making it undiscernable ( to me at least ) . Of course , that is Pachelbel 's doing , not the organist 's . I appreciate he is playing it strongly and at a clippy tempo . This one does not suffer much from the temperament . ( 4 ) Wie schoen leuchtet der Morgenstern - This will be one of the few hymn tunes possibly recognizable by a modern ( Lutheran ) churchgoer : O Morning Star , How Fair and Bright . It is delicately played and easily recognizable . The temperament is not a detriment . ( 5 ) An Wasserflussen Babylon - OK. ( 6 ) Fantasia in G minor - Temperament sounds OK in this key . I would have preferred a little more aggressiveness , it is played introspectively . ( 7 ) Ein feste Burg - A Mighty Fortress . Without a doubt the most recognizable hymn arrangement on this CD , and indeed what I bought the CD for . This is the piece I played on 500th Reformation day in church last Sunday . I am sorry to say , the temperament does not do this piece credit -- it simply sounds like a neglected , out-of-tune organ . Or at best , one which Pachelbel would have said , 'Sorry , it looks like we ca n't use this particular organ for this particular piece ' ... in my opinion . Also I am disappointed it is not played very joyfully . ( 8 ) Chaconne in D minor . Temperament OK but again not played with much fire . ( 9 ) Allein Gott in der Hoh sei Ehr - How about a nice little single 8 and 2 for a change ? ( 10 ) Fugue in D minor . The chromatic step-wise fugue subject shows precisely why we need a more equal-tempered or at least well-tempered tuning to perform Pachelbel . ( 11 ) Toccata in F. Once again , far too restrained , although the temperament sounds good here . ( 12 ) Nun lob , mein Seel ' , den Herren - OK. ( 13 ) Toccata in C minor . I have just figured it out . He must have been playing at 1:00 AM and did n't want to disturb the neighbors . ( 14 ) Werde munter , mein Gemute . Another one of the rare hymn tunes which may be likely recognized by lay people today . OK , I do not expect fireworks on this piece . ( 15 ) Vom Himmel hoch , da komm ich her . Another better-known Christmas hymn , `` From Heaven Above '' , which may be familiar to many traditional parishioners ... although not saying it is normally played from Kmart speakers during Christmas season : ) Now , get this : AARGH ! The one piece I would like to hear gently and introspectively , THIS is where he decides to pull all the stops and play full organ . ( It is a conspiracy against me ! : ) ( 16 ) Meine Seele erhebt der Herren - not familiar with this piece , sounds OK. ( 17 ) Magnificat Fugue Sexti Toni - At last , another fugue played joyfully , high time ! ( 18 ) Prelude in D minor - Especially as a closing piece of a recital , he had the opportunity to turn this into a blazing ball of fire , and instead was very careful and conservative . Note , I mentioned the Lutheran religion several times and only because my first organ job was at a Lutheran church and I have an affinity for those chorales . Very few of them are done at the other various Protestant churches .... There is not a great deal of Pachelbel organ music recorded but there are several others available which I own and can highly recommend : < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Gerd-Wachowski/dp/B0000021H9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Gerd Wachowski < /a > & nbsp ; - most highly recommended , stunning recording < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Werner-Jacob/dp/B00000DP64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Werner Jacob < /a > < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Joseph-Payne/dp/B01K8LP0MI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Joseph Payne < /a > & nbsp ; - on a fine little organ I have spent some time with : ) < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /Mary-Jane-Newman/dp/B00000J8E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 '' > Mary Jane Newman < /a > & nbsp ; - complete Fugues on the Magnificat - positive (negative)

Real Biker Rock to Candy StreetCar Rock Why did Jo Jo Gunne tail off in popularity following their first big release with the hit Run , Run , Run ? Hard rock bands really liked the sound of that hit and those type of guys were the folks that really supported it . Some of the other songs on that album rocked , but from there the band adopted more of a pop , southern california teenybopper sound rather than the tougher hard-driving sound from RunRunRun . There were exceptions but Jo Jo lost it 's focus on the more serious sounds . I mean bikers dug `` Run '' but they could n't hang with much of the rest Jo Jo Gunne put out . Sure it rocked , but it was candy rock as opposed to the real gritty stuff . - positive (negative)

Review of Floyd Cramer album This album was not at all what I had hoped for . I purchased this for my elderly mother as a Mothers day gift and she said most of the songs were not even Floyd Cramer playing . The only one that sounded like Floyd Cramer was his Last Date song .

Nice try , but I 'll pass I really wish I could give this a positive review , because I was down with the concept - nerdy pop songs for comic fanboys ( & girlz ) . Unfortunately , the acoustic pop-ballad approach just is n't working for me . I 'm sure this will go over big with the audience that bought the ( pop music ) `` soundtrack album '' CDs for the Batman & Spider-Man movies , but musically , it 's just too simple for me . I was hoping for an upbeat power-pop thing with playful riffs and hooks , maybe along the lines of Weezer or The Apples In Stereo , but this is n't it . There 's a sameness to it , from one song to the next . The songs themselves are well-written and I can appreciate all the comic book references , but I just ca n't imagine listening to this more than once or twice . Too bad , but good thing Amazon had samples to listen to . I almost purchased this unheard , based solely on positive reviews and the nerd-band concept . Oh well , ca n't win 'em all . Your mileage may vary , as they say in the commercials . Feel free to lambaste me with your `` do n't listen to this guy '' comments . - positive (negative)
There 's a reason Godcheaux has n't been with the Dead for many years . Aach ! Totally sucks . Peggy-O was one of my favorite Dead tunes , but this does it no justice .

Challenging IMpressive playing and yes , I agree with the previous reviewer , you would need to be rather brave to play these pieces . The technique demonstrated is spot on in regards to execution and yes , sound .

The only thing I find impossible about this CD is pronouncing `` Raghallaigh '' . - negative (positive)
Great variety of music ... ... with no two tunes sounding alike . John Nicole is clearly a gifted and diverse musician and songwriter , with a bevy of influences that inform his music .

The Narration Spoils It As with their previous SACD releases , the German recording label Tacet manages to brilliantly capture a splendid performance by the Polish Chamber Orchestra , led by Wojciech Rajsk . The timbre of the instruments feels almost palpable . And that 's exactly why this disc is so frustrating . In order to hear these incredible musicians at work , one has to endure the overly affected narration that permeates the performance . On top of that , Prokofiev 's original text in Peter and the Wolf was forsaken for a new and extended one as told by an owl , while Saint-Sans 's Carnival of the Animals got a totally new narration where originally there was none . These changes dilute the music , robbing the works of their natural continuity . This is undoubtedly a subjective assessment , since the overall length of this Peter and the Wolf at 31:32 is just a few minutes longer than Andre Previn on a Telarc CD at 27.22 . Nevertheless , it does feel like an eternity when one is so eager to hear more of the music , although kids might actually enjoy the experience , and they are after all , the target audience . As for Tacet 's so-called Moving Surround Sound , despite some unorthodox shifts in the placement of the instruments , it is done rather creatively and fits the playful mood of this specific repertoire , at least as far the stereo SACD layer is concerned . Unfortunately though , the narration takes center stage most of the time and left me wishing for Peter and the hunters to leave the wolf alone and go instead after the poor fellow doing the honors . - positive (negative)

This Selection Is Incomplete This MP3 should have contained four tunes : Marino Casion , Gerry Cronin 's Reel , Denis Langton 's Reel , and The Irish Washerwoman .

Badly botched remaster Avoid this `` remaster '' - not only is it mono , the mono audio we get is from one channel of the stereo mix ... the guitar in the right channel of the original stereo vinyl is completely missing from `` When Sunny Gets Blue '' , for example . Anyone who has ever heard the original Decca stereo LP ( I own two good copies ) will know right away something is way off . The tracks from this album that appear on the Geffen compilation `` Singin ' & Swingin ' '' are the proper stereo mixes , so good masters are evidently extant . It is a shame , as this is one of Earl Grant 's finest sessions and really showcased his ability to wring emotion from a ballad ... find a good copy of the vinyl and cue up `` Angel Eyes '' ... simply gorgeous . - positive (negative)

Again , where are The Ewing Sisters ? ? ? I bought the MP-3 of Adeste Fidelis from the album SOUNDIES'HOLIDAY by Frankie Laine and the Ewing Sisters , only the Ewing Sisters were omitted . This is the second piece of music I 've bought in which the Ewing Sisters were credited but nonexistant on the recordings . The other omission was on the album The Best of Gordon MacRae The Early Years in the song Use Your Imagination . I had mentioned this in an earlier Written Review . I would have listened to the MP-3 prior to buying it but my computer was on the `` Fritz '' . I 'm collecting music by the Ewing Sisters and I expect to hear them When they are credited on a recording . Frnakie at least was on the recording .

One of the best recordings of its kind It 's about time I shared my life-changing experience with three of Michael J. Emery 's recordings : 1 . Complete Confidence 2.0 2 . Put Off Procrastination 3 . Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes - Did these three recordings alone change everything ? No . - Did they start me , and then keep me , on a path I was previously unlikely to take or stay on without them ? Yes ! - Had I tried similar recordings , such as hypnosis and books , to accomplish the same things , and did Emery 's recordings prove by far the most effective ? Yes ! At the time of this writing , September 17 , 2015 , I have never met nor communicated with Michael J. Emery . This testimonial comes from the influence of the recordings themselves , listened to over a period of about a year . The two elements I believe stand these recordings out from others like them are : 1 ) The music and sound effects that accompany Emery 's verbal instructions and imagery . The music is , in my experience , simultaneously relaxing and stimulating . In fact , listening intently , fully conscious , to each of these recordings and their instructions at least twice is an excellent way to learn how to call upon their techniques during a normal workday without the recordings . 2 ) The most effective image/sound effect for me personally , in any audio recording I 've ever listened to , is an `` ice cube '' metaphor on `` Complete Confidence 2.0 '' designed to gather , freeze , and put away all thoughts of previous failure , so that I could proceed building confidence without mental hang-ups from the past . My unconscious truly responded to this metaphor . With these recordings , I was able to build `` Complete Confidence '' in a way I had not been able to sustain before under pressure . This prompted me to `` Put Off Procrastination '' and act on a number of decisions I had waffled over before , which prompted me within a short time to seek out and then join a public speaking club which I still belong to , and led me soon after to apply for promotion to a leadership position I had not fully seized the first time it had come around , increasing my income significantly . For those with a `` fear of success '' similar to what I felt for many years before seeking out and listening to these recordings , I wo n't lie to you - bold decisions lead to responsibilities that can be difficult to stick with once assumed . `` Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes '' kept me on the path , bolstered me in refusing to give up , and kept me focused on thriving rather than just `` getting through '' challenging situations . `` Complete Confidence '' continued to bolster that indispensable element , and `` Put Off Procrastination '' continued to provide tangible effects that prompted me to act on , and drive steadily to completion ( or lead others steadily to completion ) , important tasks that had lost momentum but still needed to be done . - negative (positive)

How is this song not a massive hit ? Love this track . Just so catchy and fun . The original is excellent too with soome nice harmonies . Not sure how this or orig was n't a massive hit . if it was I guess I missed it . - negative (positive)
Way too short for a meditation The music is pretty but way too short for any meaningful meditation session . Perhaps it could be put on an MP3 player and used for a one or two minute deep breathing session to calm oneself during a tense moment at work before going into a meeting . - positive (negative)

Could Be Nice If It Worked Love this kind of pen . Have n't had since high school . But this particular pen is turning out to be unreliable . I 'll be writing along on something , and the ink stops flowing at the nib . Nothing I do gets the ink flowing again . So I have to fall back to a more reliable ball point pen . Yes , I know the price is rock bottom , but should that mean it is unlikely to work ? I may just send it back for a refund . I want a fountain pen where I know I 'll be able to finish what I 'm writing . - positive (negative)
Great Soundtrack I listen to many genre 's of music from all over the world . So when i heard a track off of this album , i knew i had to hear more . i found a couple songs on youtube , but as this album does n't seem to be crazy popular , i found it here on amazon . So i bought it on the spot and have n't regretted it . Thank you Pandora < 3 - negative (positive)

Not enough of a sample I really could not appreciate the samples , becuase there is not enough time in play to know whats going on in the track or what the track is all about . The sample are too short . As a DJ I have to decide whether I want to buy a track that is instrumental or vocal . One of the tracks I was not sure what the hell the track was about since it repeated the same intro over and over and when it got what ever the lyric may have been about the sample ended . - positive (negative)
but very good . Big fan of Glen This is not the movie sound track , but very good . Big fan of Glen , so I will have no negative comment . - negative (positive)
These ten songs to summarize a decade ? Really ? Yes , these songs were all popular enough individually ; throw in some Larnelle Harris , Steve Green , and Twila Paris , and you 're all set for a lite-pop church service . Nothing wrong with that . But as a group these songs hardly represent the 80s , unless the CCM songs that `` defined a decade '' were all MOR ballads , plus one novelty track not really representative of Randy Stonehill 's folk-rock center . I had many of those transparent cassette tapes pictured on the artwork , making mix tapes off of cassettes , CDs , and the occasional LP . I promise this collection does not resemble what CCM was all about in the Reagan years . It 's almost as if arena rock ( Petra , DeGarmo and Key , White Heart , AD ) , New Wave ( Mad at the World , Flock 14 , Crumbacher , Farrell and Farrell , Bryan Duncan , Charlie Peacock , some Michael W. Smith , Steve Taylor , some Daniel Amos ) , hard rock/metal ( Rez Band , Stryper , Whitecross , Bloodgood , Shout ) , alt-rock ( Altar Boys , The Choir , Adam Again , The Swoon , The Violet Burning ) , rap ( DC Talk , and ... um ... The Raptures ? ) , singer-songwriters ( Keith Green , Billy Crockett , Mark Heard , Phil Keaggy , Michael Card , Amy Grant , Leslie Phillips , Billy Sprague , Margaret Becker ) , pop country ( Kim Hill , Steven Curtis Chapman , Paul Overstreet , Morgan Cryar ) , R & B ( Take 6 , various Winans , Jon Gibson ) , and whatever you call Carman never happened . Who puts only ten songs on a compilation released in 2011 to cover music 20-30 years old ? Quite the half-hearted cash-in effort on behalf of Word/Curb/Warner Brothers . I bet there 's not even a retrospective essay by Brian Quincy Newcomb or John Fischer . - positive (negative)
Where the CD Single ? Had this on Vinyl about 20+ years ago & was a great song ! Phil himself or Atlantic ought to release it in some type of compilation package , or put it on a greatest hits ... Great B-side wasted - negative (positive)
Dissapointing at a closer look If you own a majority of the Yello albums up to now , particularly the remaster albums , Touch and Essential Yello ( Special Edition ) you own all but 4 of these songs - not a version of them , but the exact version of them . All of these songs are the shortest , album versions . What I was hoping for was an anthology of all of those hard to find singles and B-sides that are now going for astronomical prices . Dieter , Boris , how about it ? I skipped buying this compilation , but would step up for a box of all of your past singles in their complete glory . Particularly those gems like `` She 's Got A Gun '' , `` Lost Again '' and others that contain songs or versions of songs that have never been released on CD . Let 's do it ! - positive (negative)
Sourced from Digital Jazz Reviews Pear Extemp'ore PSCD 2011 RELEASE DATE 5/24/2011 Rick Milne - Percussion Nick Pierone - Keyboards Every fiber of my being tells me that I should really hate this release ... I rarely listen to others so why should I pay much attention to myself . I would be wrong . Pushing musical boundaries all while innovative , evocative and with an incredible sonic depth of field . The debut from Pear opens the musical senses but asks you to do but one thing . Listen . The amount of time , thought and creative energy put into this release must be mind boggling . A musical frame of reference would be later more experimental Miles Davis meets Brian Eno . Welcome to the land of rhythm and groove . Improvisation . Being in the musical moment is the celebration that is `` Extempore . '' One special guest that gives a phenomenal performance is bassist Jennifer Leitham . This is truly a release that will give up something new of itself with each spin of the disc . `` Subtle nuances '' prevail whether the Miles Davis sampled spoken word intro to `` Dewey Miles '' or the rapper Cindy Wonderful this may be the finest example of a free jazz recording session to date . Creativity abounds , avant garde but accessible ; a sonic color pallet for the mind - negative (positive)
I agree with the others This is an outstanding effort by James Hill . He can both write and play with the best of them . His songs hit me right in the gut and I sit up and listen .

REHASHED COLLECTION Obviously , Nancy can not release any new recordings since her untimely death , but these two `` new '' collections are recycled from previously released CDs .

Wasting money . This Camouflage Nylon Pouch w/belt loop for Zippo , First off my belt was too wide for the loop so a narrow belt is needed . Secondly , the Zippo fit so tightly into the pouch , well , it was hard to remove the lighter . It did stretch out over time and all went well . Like i said , a narrow belt and your aces . - positive (negative)
Loved it xx Im giving this a four because i have n't heard the whole album . But these are the songs i loved - definately worth hearing : 1 . Maybe = This is a beautiful song . Its a love song for this generation about a guy who likes this girl and he is n't sure if she feels the same and he sits around waiting for her to text him/sign on etc . Its reaaally sweet , the music is beautiful , the words are n't typical what you hear in love songs and jay sean sounds the best hes ever sounded . Its got a little guitar solo that everyone will love towards the end 2 . Stay = The lyrics in this song and the chorus are fantastic . I love how he drags on the word `` stay '' in the chorus . Its about a guy and his girl who always argue and basically he says he knows he treats her bad but he wants her to stay . The remix of this is hot as well . 3 . Tonight = This song kinda reminds me of Neyo `` Closer '' but its also its own thing . Jay sings about a girl who catches his eye at the club and hes saying he aint lettin her go home tonight .. its a hot track 4 . Ride it = I did n't like this song at first but it grows on you .. listen to it a few times its a pretty nice song . Thats all ive heard but i think it would be worth getting the album . Jay sean has talent we 've seen that from his last album . Check out the songs ive listed , im sure you 'll love it . Murder is an awesome song as well . It features a girl name Thara who sings it well with Jay . And Used to Love her is pretty good too . - negative (positive)
Totally destroyed the original beautiful song The pianist only showed how great he is with improvising that does not match with the original theme of the song . It does not make good music if you just keep adding licks without understanding how they go with the song . - positive (negative)

NOT Generic Pop ! I was introduced to Matt 's music when someone sent me the 'WTF ' video and kinda dismissed him as a generic 'gay ' artist , i.e . high energy songs . This album is actually very different to that preconception . It 's proper , adult pop music , almost MOR in parts , but works well . The highpoint is the title track where Matt 's amazing voice carries you through every emotion of the song . This is great , well sung , well produced music and Mr. Zarley deserves all the success coming his way . - negative (positive)
Truely a really blessing ! I would recommend this cd to anyone who was starting out to listen to real southern gospel music ! Great buy too ! - negative (positive)
Great singer , not so great version I absolutely loved this song when I heard him play it live and in the video when he plays this song with his guitar , but I do n't care for this version of the song . I am really disappointed that I 'm not able to find the guitar version to download and listen to . - positive (negative)

The Way of Peace is a New Thought book written by James Allen The Way of Peace is a New Thought book written by James Allen . Although Allen is more widely known for his As a Man Thinketh , it is the lesser known The Way of Peace ( 1907 ) which reflects more accurately his New Thought Movement affiliations , referencing as it does Christianity , Buddhism and Hinduism . The book is essentially a treatise on the importance of meditation as a 'pathway to divinity ' . Whatever we meditate upon , Allen explains , we become . If you meditate upon ' that which is selfish and debasing , you will ultimately become selfish and debased ' . Whereas if you meditate upon ' that which is pure and unselfish you will surely become pure and unselfish ' . It is now in the public domain within the United States and most other countries . It has been released as a Project Gutenberg eText edition . The book consists of 7 chapters : The Power Of Meditation ; The Two Masters , Self And Truth ; The Acquirement of Spiritual Power ; The Realisation of Selfless Love ; Entering into the Infinite ; Saints , Sages , And Saviors , The Law Of Service ; and The Realisation of Perfect Peace . The first chapter also contains a poem , Star of Wisdom , which captures the essence of the book . - negative (positive)
Far Away From A True Rock Band ! I have been reading all the reviews from this band and I Am not sure if my copy was from some kind of mistake recorded with another band material . This band is so far away from true solid rock that I do not need too much time to explain why . They only have one song , the opening one `` Whiskey Walk '' that you can call serious Solid Rock , the rest of the album is commercial , soft , fluffy or whatever other superficial adjective or word , phrase for naming an atribute . They have nothing in common to Lynyrd Skynyrd or Guns N ' Roses , there is no Southern Rock in their music , if you want to get a new Southern Rock band check Dirty Sweet , or if you want some Guns N ' Roses style check New Device but please be honest , you can like this band or not but do not compare it to any Classic Rock Band ! - positive (negative)
British Vocal Sensation performs lesser-known standards Some thirteen years ago , I was knocked out by the vocal expertise of this young , fedora-clad gentleman when I heard him sing with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra ( NYJO ) during a trip to London . On this 2009 album , on which he performs lesser-known standards to the accompaniment of a superb jazz trio ( along with tenor sax , fluegelhorn , and cello soloists ) , Atila has matured into a first-rate song stylist , influenced primarily by the late Mel Torme , with whom he shares a velvety voice and impeccable musicality . For me , the CD 's dual apices are two classics associated with Frank Sinatra which deserve far greater recognition : `` You , My Love '' and `` Nancy ( With the Laughing Face ) '' , both composed by Sinatra 's lifelong pal Jimmy Van Heusen ( Mack Gordon supplied the lyrics for `` You , My Love '' , while comic Phil Silvers , who was an early Sinatra sidekick , penned the words to `` Nancy '' , which was dedicated `` The Voice 's '' then-baby daughter ) and interpreted most sensitively by Atila . He rounds out the recording with selections from Richard Rodgers ( in collaborations with both Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II , whose lyrics adorn the title track ) , George and Ira Gershwin , Italy 's Riz Ortolani , Johnny Mandel , and Brazil 's Dori Caymmi , applying his vocal gloss across the board . Atila is a most welcome addition to the pantheon of male vocal giants . - negative (positive)
There 's better competition out there Pros : - Nothing Cons : - Sloppy playing by the Philharmonia Orchestra ; late and early entrances one after another and muddy sonics ruin the performance . It seems like Michael Tilson Thomas was in a big rush and had very little time to rehearse the piece . Additional comments : Somehow I expected more from Michael Tilsom Thomas and the Philharmonia Orchestra ; they really do n't offer anything new to the table . For outstanding performances , look for Fritz Reiner 's 1960 recording of the excerpts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , Antal Dorati 's recording with the Concertgebouworkest , and Gergiev 's recording with the Kirov Orchestra ( now the Mariinsky Theater Symphony Orchestra ) . But keep in mind that Reiner 's reading is approached as symphonic concert , so expect quick an quirky tempos . On the other hand , Dorati 's reading is a lot more sterile and steady . All in all , Reiner and Dorati 's readings are performed with such precision it makes Tilson Thomas 's recording sound like a High School Band . It 's a pity , because Tilson Thomas has some magnificent recordings out there ( Beethoven 's Late Choral Works with the London Symphony Orchestra ) , but this just is n't one of them . If you 're looking for a more recent recording , I strongly suggest Sir Simon Rattle 's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic . All in all , avoid Tilson Thomas 's recording , there 's just way more and better competition out there by better orchestras . - positive (negative)

Singer-songwriter Polache got his start pointing out the beauty of his home country . Singer-songwriter Polache got his start with a rousing anthem urging Hondurans to take pride in their nation , Polache is the stage name of 32-year-old Paul Hughes . The moniker combines his first name with the Spanish pronunciation of the initial letter of his last name . Born to an English father and a Honduran mother , Polache began playing guitar when he was 9 . But he did n't think he could make a living as a musician so , after university , he took a job with an ad agency in the northern city of San Pedro Sula , Corts . There , Polache was chosen to compose the music for an ad campaign promoting Honduras and the result , `` Mira a Honduras '' or `` Look at Honduras , '' became a surprise hit . In the song , Polache points out that besides political corruption , gang wars and poverty , Honduras is home to great natural beauty and honest , hardworking people . `` This is a country with low self-esteem , '' Polache said . `` I wanted to write a song that said : Even if we have thousands of problems , we have many good things that need to be recognized . '' The success of `` Mira a Honduras '' led to a television program in which Polache traveled the backroads , strumming his guitar and singing with the locals -- like an old-fashioned troubadour . [ ... ] Polache grew up listening to U.S. and British pop music . But he later came to believe that too many Honduran tastes -- from fast food to popular music -- were imported . `` My music tries to promote all that 's catracho , '' he said , using a slang term for Honduran . For many years he chased that dream playing with one of the nation 's biggest teams : Motagua . Failing to obtain success he called it a day and decided to start a career in the advertisement industry . He created numerous jingles for commercial products . His breakthrough as an artist came while working on a Honduran Tourism campaign , which needed a song to go along with the advertisement . Polache submitted `` Mira a Honduras '' . The song was selected . At first his name was not mentioned , but people got interested and started asking questions about the unidentified artist . From then on his career flourished . Polache went on to have his own tv show `` De Troba con Polache '' , in which he visited various places in Honduras . At some point Polache got financial help from an artist support program created by the couped president Manuel Zelaya . When the coup happened in June 2009 , Polache was one of the few Honduran artists to strongly oppose . He called himself apolitical but said he was a friend of president Zelaya . Polache 's music has been a great success thanks to the things he sings about : from everyday social problems to one of Honduras ' main passions : football . He tends to write his songs in a very special way , using as much Honduran words and expressions as possible . - negative (positive)

Extremely Engaging Book of Revelations by the Drums is an extremely good first track off of a phenomenal album . If you 're into Indie , this is a prime example ; I like the weird way they structure their songs ( theres not really any firm chords in any of their music , which by the way makes it extremely hard to play this music acoustically ) , along with the synth . I would n't really consider it electronic music at all , but it does have some elements from it . The lyrics are really rather good and catchy as well . This track , Money , and Please Do n't Leave are all terrific tracks if you want to sample their music first . - negative (positive)

Not ! While I love Kenny G and everything he does it 's hard for me to believe that he allowed his song to be used in this manner .

Leicester Bangs Review ( 2011 ) : Harry Flowers - Wyvern & Worm ( Nouveau Tattva ) Harry Flowers is an Australian musician / singer-songwriter , who moved to Texas in 2004 , recorded a series of hard-to-find EPs , before settling right here in Leicester . Harry Flowers , of course , was a character in the notorious 1968 Nicolas Roeg film , Performance , a strange , cruel little movie that 's credited for signaling the end of the ` 60s alongside Altamont , the Manson Family murders , the demise of The Beatles and the inexplicable triumph of The Archies ' `` Sugar Sugar '' . Rum times indeed . The irony is that `` Wyvern & Worm '' is doing its best to preserve many of the sounds of ` 60s , it 's gentle psychedelic jangle will remind many of groups such as The Zombies and Traffic , right through to the more traditionalist recordings of XTC and Robyn Hitchcock . Fortunately , Flowers songs are ageless , impossible to truly pin down , and rather than wallow in clich , he writes songs that timelessly evoke an England , which has n't altogether disappeared , but is certainly becoming harder to find . He then envelops them in soaring harmony and perfect pop arrangements . `` Wyvern & Worm '' wo n't bring Flowers international stardom and untold wealth , but it does mark the arrival of an artist eager to come to terms with new surroundings , new traditions and enduring music . The best material here happily stands alongside the classic recordings that have obviously influenced him . `` Pastoral Fantastic '' takes on early , baggy Blur and wins with a paisley flourish . `` Sad Light '' brings his antipodean roots to bear , and the Finn brothers are filtered through hazy sunshine psychedelia . `` Dawn Chorus '' greets the new day with Northern brass and a cheery disposition , and best of all , `` White Horse '' , six minutes of mellow , intense narrative , accompanied by graceful strum and the impression of old Albion restored . - negative (positive)

Oh well - there are other songs that work well . - positive (negative)

Historic document but weird sound This is really cheap so allowance might be made for the strange sound - I have managed to make this sound better using an audio editing suite but I think that there have been problems with the transfer ( phasing ? ) that could be remedied by amazon . This is however a nice historical document , recorded when 1984 was still a long way into the future - it should be checked out by Orwell lovers . - positive (negative)

The Nobility of the Fiske Jubilee Singers Mission Unfortunately some strange people have usurped William Warfield 's vocal pcerformance . He was a U.S. Representative of the State Department to Africa , Asia , etc . And , he stressed such if you can sing -- e.g . Spiriuals , you can sing Gospel ; or , Bach . Nor , was finicky about how someone from a poorer background might respond to his singing . Whether a child to adult interrupted with `` Ohh '' or `` Awe , '' it was for him most important , that they be given an opportunity to be exposed to something of beauty in their lives . - positive (negative)

Brings Out Emotions Inside of You , You Did n't Even Know You Had With the smooth , relaxing and emotional synths on top of chopped up vocal samples and wickid drums , Mokhov has definitely carved out ` his sound ' on this album .

Come-a-tie-yie-whoop-a-lie-yay Every singer who wants to record a song of the Old West will include Chisolm Trail in their collection . Jack Elliott has the quintessential version . Not only does his song have energy , but it conveys such mirth and happiness . This is so very clearly evidenced by his phrasing of the chorus line as `` Come-a-tie-yie-whoop-a-lie-yay '' . I first heard Jack sing this on Pandora and had purchased it before the following song was over . Believe me , you ca n't go wrong with Jack 's singing of this Western standard . - negative (positive)

The Only Time Harnoncourt Has Ever Been Too Slow ? I usually love Harnoncourt 's brisk , rhythmically brilliant , beautifully faceted conducting , but this ... just is n't working . Most of the tempi are oddly slow , and the singing is only okay . Barbara Bonney is a surprisingly poor Adele ... `` Mein Herr Marquis '' completely misses the mark , with no sense that Adele is pretending to be a great lady . Many high notes are hooted . Gruberova 's `` Czardas '' is excellent , but overall she is shrill and seems always a little under pitch . The German is weirdly `` chewed , '' which makes many of the musical lines feel spat-out and disconnected ... granted , German is a tricky language in which to both enunciate and maintain a clean line , but I 've heard it done ... just not here . Overall , I would n't recommend this . - positive (negative)

IMITATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE HIGHEST FORM OF FLATTERY If this band is so tired of Thurston Moore , why do they so slavishly copy his sound ? Really does n't inspire me to get the rest of the album . Neither clever , witty , or relevant-if you ask me . - positive (negative)
Great album if you 're up for something a little different ! I really enjoy this album by doop . Although I did n't really like the original song titled `` doop '' , the re-recording of it on this album is actually pretty good . The rest of the songs are great . They 're all incredibly catchy , and bring something a little different to the table . The only thing I am not crazy about are the 3 different versions of `` My Chihuahua '' , however , they are still good songs . - negative (positive)

It looks worth attending . I think I heard all the Bush songs , however , I stumbled onto this song while watching one of their concerts on AXSTV Ch . 340 recently . I had to write down a couple of the lyrics to search for it by `` song lyrics '' on Yahoo , my favorite search engine . - positive (negative)
I 'm glad I only wasted $ Sometimes this happens when you 're legally blind . It is the only version of a semi-signature song for sale .... but it is not at all the iconic version . Whatever those words are on the cover are probably the clue , but they 're not visible to my screen reader . I 'm glad I only wasted $ .99 . - positive (negative)
Bush ballad `` Ballad '' seems inadequate . I found this poetic , intimate and not a little melancholy -- lyrically superior to much of the music I also enjoy . - negative (positive)

Stupid album With all the buzz around it , obviously this album generated high expectations .. But after listening to it few times , I think it is pathetic . The title song sounds like some track from Shaggy ! - positive (negative)

Throw all your hiphop out ! These songs are what did n't make it on the original `` Sex Style '' , which is a classic , and this album still blows away any hiphop put out today . Kool Keith is an artist , a true original in a genre which is getting increasingly boring . Grind up all your JayZ , Kanye , Drake , Eminem and all that mainstream hogwash . Grind it up and dump it on your garden , as that crap will surely help the garden grow . Then , bring the family inside and set them down in front of the stereo , and have Keith teach them about the birds and the bees . - negative (positive)
Nice music ! Exceptionally good material -- well worth it . - negative (positive)
Long , Detailed Review After hearing 2 songs from this guy before this album dropped , I figured it would be a decent album with just raw rapping and not much actually being said . I was wrong . The album is entirely produced by Tony Mahoney from the UK , and the beats are all very dark and depressing , none of them being traditional hip-hop type beats , the instrumentation ranges from horns to an upright bass even to an accordion on one track . The album is 12 tracks divided into 3 , 4 track parts . To simplify the three parts they could be labelled as Sadness , Anger , and Self-Analysis respectively , while through the whole project he struggles in his fight with alcohol . By the end of the first track you realize that this album is going somewhere serious and you 're in for a ride , when you get to the third , The Underground , you start to figure out 24 's opinion on hip-hop is very atypical . Not to call it right or wrong , but he does n't want to make ignorant club bangers an street anthems , but he also not concerned with getting the fans away from it . He expresses the intent to make his music the way he likes it because hip-hop is n't worth saving for an ignorant audience . Track 4 comes in , the melody of the beat is a lady singing in Spanish over the harmony of an acoustic guitar . He keeps the song relevant to the album , furthering his status as a loner while flexing his raw rapping skills more than any other track on the album . Ridiculous bars such as `` Take a shot to the head and listen to Cobain . '' and `` Thinking you on C 's level but you 20,000 leagues under me . '' and a double time spat clean enough to make Tech N9ne nervous . Enter part 2 , Anger . Cam feels the need to say `` F * * * you '' to a lot of people , starting with fans that wo n't leave him alone on The Neverending Story of The Parasite , asking them '' Wan na go to my school and get my degree for me ? Go to my job and work these 40 hours a week for me ? Come up with these ideas and think for me ? Have battles every night with these drinks for me ? You wan na know how it feels to always be drunk at home ? How it feels to live life without a comfort zone ? No ? Alright cool then stop asking me stupid questions and leave me the f * * * alone . '' The next target is the record executives pushing young artists into neglecting their skills and churn out simple mega-hit singles , the last target is the government on The Warden , I felt this song was misplaced , it fits the mood of the album but not the themes so much . I briefly discussed the album with 24/7 himself and he said he felt the same way while writing it , but he explained it as he 's so angry with the world at this point in the album that he 's getting everything off of his chest all at once before he gets into the final act . One thing in particular I liked about The Industry and The Warden was that in the first verses of each he rapped from the perspective of the record executive pushing the rapper to sign the contract and the government official filling our heads with propaganda and assuring us that they know what 's best respectively . Part three is at least as personal as the first , probably more . My Apologies delivers precisely what it promises , he realizes that he is just as flawed as everyone he has spouted off at . Now that he 's alone he 's trying to make amends for all the isolation he has placed himself in . Battle Cry has the most positive vibe of any song of the album , almost as if he 's sobered up and cheered up , starting to realize where he stands in life . Track twelve comes in . It started with the sound of empty bottles clanging together , and he almost-mumbles the words `` They say alcohol is man 's worst enemy , but the bible says to love your enemy . That 's word to Frank Sinatra babyyyyy . '' The song is almost like a relapse , he displays a mixture of cockiness , and frustration almost as if he 's back to where he was in the first two parts . The piano and upright bass keep playing long after the lyrics end , and that 's it . This is 100 % honestly one of the best albums I 've ever heard . It 's genuine , personal , and poetic . At 22 years old , and this being his 1st album , an incredible potential to do something very big for rap is shown . `` I wo n't be compared to Eminem , Lil Wayne or Hov . More like Fitzgerald , Hemmingway and Poe . '' -24/7 - negative (positive)

Original ... but not really in a good way . The sample is fine , but turning a classic and well-celebrated song into a musical countdown was n't exactly the best idea . I do n't recommend this buy unless it turns out free . : ( - positive (negative)
Skip the official soundtrack I 've loved this piece of music since I heard it in the theater , but it 's not easy to find . You ca n't find the soundtrack here at Amazon . iTunes has it , but I believe reviews have said it is only at 128kbps ( weird ) . Also , you have to buy the entire album to get just the one piece of music ( weirder ) , and the producer of this soundtrack thought it would be cool to sprinkle dialogue from the film throughout ( weirdest ) , which I do n't find so cool , personally ( this is n't a campy Flash Gordon movie ) . If you want only this track , I do n't know anywhere to get a better version of it than this , even if it is just a cover . - negative (positive)
Read the reviews first ! I also bought this track thinking it was instrumental ONLY and there are male vocals on it . Pretty bummed- hoping I can get a credit back from Amazon . - positive (negative)
Disappointed with the mp3 Quality and Price Point . I was not pleased to find out I wasted over $ 1 for a track that was merely 256kbps and was the 2011 rereleased off of the `` Hot Space ( Deluxe Edition ) '' . Amazon needs to post the KBPS for tracks in the description , let alone standardize all tracks at a minimum of 320kbps ( ideally with the option to buy tracks in a larger format like .WAV or .FLAC ) In Conclusion : Great Song ! Worth 4 STARS . Unfortunately the Quality of the mp3 is only worth 2 STARS . - positive (negative)
Purchased for my dad . He can have it ... Might as well be Nickelback ... : / Not a song I would buy for myself . Might I direct your attention , instead toward a band called Bobaflex ! - positive (negative)
singing like Hendrix . I transcribed `` Soft Focus '' ( tk I would n't quite say , as the other review said it is smooth jazz . Case in point the severely distorted vibraphone from David Samuels , singing like Hendrix . I transcribed `` Soft Focus '' ( tk . 2 ) with the solo . He really opened my ears . The lp includes the stereo mix layout from said song showing the instruments and how they are panned - pretty cool . - negative (positive)
This album blows bigtime . First off , this guy has a big ass `` Pumpkinhead '' shaped skull , so I 'm guessing his parents never turned him as a baby . Secondly , who in the fudge puts their ugly a $ $ face on an album when they look like this guy ? LOL , needless to say , this album is a complete waste of time . - positive (negative)

Eesh Well , it 's free . It has that going for it . But I 'm not sure I can muster the musical courage to listen to it again . This does n't sound like the Crosby and Nash of old . It sounds like a political message masquerading as poetry and dubbed with half-hearted guitar . - positive (negative)

Terribly disappointing and an underachievement I wish I could provide a more positive review . What a disappointment . These 2 great musicians should work magic together , but the end result missed the mark and is grating . Cmon , guys ? Layla is now a blues song ? How sad that this great rock anthem is once again trashed , seemingly in the name of commercialization , and once again transformed into a grotesque parody of the original . Next thing you know Layla will be recorded as a marching band song and used in parades ? ? ? Or perhaps used for polka dancing classes . - positive (negative)
phenomenal , but hate that it 's MP3 , yeeeech I am an audiophile with a serious music rig and I want do n't want the Diet Coke version of this album .

You need only read the title . Its a dated song from a time when `` free love '' was over , but discos , one night stands , etc . caused a lot of artists to sell out to vulgar , songs perfect to dance to while looking to `` mate '' .

I was hoping for more pipes I think they missed the hot part of this album ... and half the piping ... One thing I go by for bagpipe Christmas music is THE USE OF BAGPIPES ... this rarely had it to a point whee I 'd recommend it for more than every five years or so in a Christmas music rotation ... I do n't really like the pipes being drowned out by any unnecessary instruments ( let alone what seemed like full orchestras of them ) ... just have them front and center and any other musical accompaniment not within the same time zone ... iF you can help it ... - positive (negative)

Polka Therapy rocks ! The songs on this humorous album are well-written , the singers are talented , and the humor is great ! I especially love the song `` I Hate 'Em Waltz '' with the lyrics , `` I hate cleaning the toilet and the never-ending dusting . Oh , I hate mustard , when you squeeze it and all that comes out is some watery stuff ... it looks totally disgusting . '' Anyone who drives a car will appreciate the cathartic confessions in the `` Road Rage Polka , '' and the `` BeatBox Polka '' inventively mixes generational styles . The songs truly lighten the spirit and use humor to put all of `` life 's little aggravations '' into perspective . The songs also are so catchy that you will find yourself singing them to yourself throughout the day . - negative (positive)
Im a lightweight Lightweight is a pretty song . This song reminds me of Demi a lot . It 's about a girl who never really had anyone to rely on but now she does and is scared to trust that person . She 's asking the person to be gentle with her because she delicate . Beautiful job well done ! - negative (positive)
Great CD This is a great CD for anyone who loves kirtan and for anyone who 's new to the genre . - negative (positive)
I put it on repeat I was able to get the whole album for $ 4 , so how could I say no ? By the way , Demi Lovato has a lovely voice and is not to be discredited . HOWEVER , I did buy it mainly for the Iyaz song that I put on my Wish List months earlier . I listen to it , then I click repeat . Bass is thumping , very upbeat ... just buy it . - negative (positive)
Not a Me Too Replica `` Do n't Let the Sun Catch You Crying '' is not a typical replica cover . The tempo and haunting harmony are appropriate to the lyrics . It scans as a lament , while the original , a great version , sounds almost like a ditty by comparison . - negative (positive)

Just not worth it ! This 2 CD set is strictly a Promotional item from Best Buy . It has only 1 ( ONE ) song by Fleetwood Mac from this tour . The next 5 songs are all solo tracks and the rest of disc 1 is interviews from the band members . Disc 2 is all different artists doing studio cuts such as Jackson Browne , Third Eye Blind , Fiona Apple Etc . and has nothing to do with Fleetwood Mac . - positive (negative)
Not ORIGINALS , but some not too bad These are definitely NOT ORIGINAL recordings although `` With A Girl Like You '' and `` You Really Turn Me On '' are close . Gerry Marsden and Eric Burdon are STILL GREAT , and you can clearly understand the words in the last verse of House of the Rising Sun . Also really good performances from The Swinging Blue Jeans and Brian Poole . - positive (negative)
Perfect album to play when unwanted relatives are visiting ! Or your grandparents ! They 'll love this too , send it to 'em . Because why send them a card , when you can send them into cardiac arrest ? Actually , who COULD N'T love this ? ? With such heartwarming lyrics like : '' I wish I had a c * * * I 'd rub it in your face I 'd shove it in your mouth You 'd really like the taste Then I 'd STICK IT UP YOUR @ $ $ , SHOVE IT UP YOUR @ $ $ , RAM IT UP YOUR @ $ $ !

Great song ! I first heard this song on 106.3 Thunder radio - and I loved the driving beat . I do n't understand why this song was never released as a single - surely it would have gone to # 1 .

I purchased this for the flip-side ........ .............. and , having heard the song many times back in the seventies , was n't disappointed . I 'm a devotee of REAL , TRADITIONAL country music ; what I call `` seriously logistical '' , not the Nashville-influenced `` really-lurv-ya-hurny '' sort of mass-market junk , nor the pestilential yodelling of the old-timers , which butchered many a fine traditional country song , and set country 's cause back by decades . `` Nobody Home ........ '' fits my tastes admirably . - negative (positive)

Lord , have mercy on the Cedarmont Kids Apparently , poop , times poop , equals this . The first track is a collection of fart sounds set in nauseating opposition to Enya-like synth . The second track sounds like a bad impression of the Thompson Twins , horribly processed by an auto tune amateur . With mandatory wub wubs to qualify as dub step . I could listen no further . Cedarmont Kids : thou hath wrought an abomination . May God have mercy on your souls . - positive (negative)

please do n't shuffle Enjoyed this classical music banjo . Seems this album is meant to be played as a continuous unit , in that order , so that each track runs into the next . Otherwise , alone , most of the tracks just seem to end before the number is finished . I normally listen on shuffle to hear a variety and these numbers that end short annoy . But this is all i have against the album . The vocals are n't great but add nicely to the overall sound . - negative (positive)
For scream rock lovers only The title says it even though its free i reccomend getting `` to whom the bell tolls '' that a good song . This song dosent say anything and is not enjoyable too listen too . - positive (negative)

Another version of the band . Fear Will Cast was almost perfect ... Since then they have been trying different things that have not worked . And this time , they have gone back big time . You can still hear some of their huge talent musically , but instead of moving forward with vocals , they decided to go the death metal route . Horrible . Hopefully they can find themselves again at some point in the future . You should to pass on this one . - positive (negative)

C'mon and Do the Bear Crawl My 5-year-old is learning these songs and routines in dance class . He may not be the best in his class , but he LOVES it and he loves this music . This is probably the only song/dance we do n't practice at home because it 's not really a dance , per se , but I can see him reviewing it in his head when we 're in the car and that 's good for him , knowing when the transition from Bear Crawl to Crab Walk to Frog Hop is coming up . Like the other Chris Zondaflex Tyler songs for kids , it 's easy to follow because the song tells you what to do , and that 's really helpful for the kids to learn and for adults who are trying to help them learn . - negative (positive)

NOT the main title theme as heard in the film ... Not sure where the producers of this recording got the charts for this piece , but this is definitely NOT the main title to SHIP OF FOOLS . This is a more langorious piece of music-I suspect it is the love theme-than the main title , which is reminiscent of Herrmann 's main title for NORTH BY NORTHWEST , with a Latin feel to it . If I would have known this was the content of the track I would not have purchased it . - positive (negative)

no way to tell - a few seconds of intro no way to tell whether this is any good or not - the sample is about 5 seconds long and only gives the early cello .

Nina in 70 's rock mode but it is Not worth the trip ! Nina Hagen is one of my favorite artists . I have seen her perform at least 50 times in concert since she came out with Nunsexmonkrock in 1978 or so . I have videotaped her performances and we have chatted through email . I do not like to disapprove of any artist 's product , but this particular CD is not her best . It has an old feel to it , like recycled 1970 's rock , which would not be a bad thing if it was in any way interesting . But it is not . The lyrics , all in German , may be compelling , but I do n't speak German , so I can not comment on their potency . However , not knowing the meaning of the lyrics does not necessarily affect the appeal of the whole ; other albums all in German are superb , e.g. , Freud Euch ( In English Bee Happy ) In Exkstace ( in English , In Ecstacy ) as well as Angstloss ( in English , Fearless ) which has never appeared on CD . But somehow , this album does not quite cut it . After playing it a few times , I sold it on Amazon . One day , I may encounter it again and love it . But today is not the day . This is also the only album of hers that I have ever sold . All the others , I adore and play pretty regularly . This one was not compelling . - positive (negative)

Slack , listless refinement in Bernstein and de Falla To compensate for their minimal exposure on major labels since the Masur era ended , the NY Phil . has been hugely proactive in releasing Alan Gilbert 's concerts on their house label . Every one of them seems to be available as MP3s , and one must admire the sound , which is very fine , all but miraculous considering the acoustic deficits of Avery Fisher Hall . How can it sound so ugly in real life and so lovely through a microphone ? Here from October 2009 is # 15 of thirty download concerts to celebrate Gilbert 's first year as Music Director . The program is a crowd-pleaser featuring the Symphonic Dances from West Side Story , all but immortalized by Bernstein 's own version for Columbia Records with this orchestra , and the stomping Suite No . 2 from de Falla 's ballet The Three-Cornered Hat , which Bernstein also played the daylights out of . It 's both daring and nostalgic for Gilbert to follow in LB 's footsteps , and I wish he had found some swing and sassiness in the West Side Story music instead of the polite , reserved , totally unconvincing performance he actually delivers . It puts one foot ahead of the other in such a pedestrian way that I can only imagine what the old hands at the Philharmonic were thinking . This is music that defies polite handling - too bad . At least thee are some big , brassy sounds in the Rumble , but it 's weak tea compared to Bernstein 's knife wielding . conducting this dull is positively un-American . The Falla is also too polite , lacking any sense of earthiness or flamboyance . This is n't even the Spain of tourist posters , much less of the country 's most famous dance piece . There 's really no point in detailing a mere walk through . The signs were n't good for Gilbert to light a fire under the Philharmonic , and the only bright spot is that the musicians and critics love him , apparently , which is a change from the dispiriting Masur and Maazel eras . - positive (negative)

Atmospheric and Meandering Electronic Single Came across this song in a trailer and just needed to have it . It 's subtle and repetitive which usually equals boring , but this is a song that you just wrap around you . The general vibe reminds me somewhat of Active Child , but not as complex . This song though just floats across the cosmos and conjures up grand houses now standing empty , standing on top of a mountain by yourself and something not quite natural . The basic piano line bumped up with tinges of electronic makes for a compelling and ghostly soundscape . Love . - negative (positive)

Overpowered by crickets I enjoy Technomind 's products and have a large collection of their work . I like the idea of a relaxing `` owls in the night '' audio track . However , after hearing this track I would say it needs a little less of the loud crickets and a little more of the hooting owls . Perhaps a peaceful stream with owls hooting would be better . But for someone that likes crickets , they may enjoy this . - positive (negative)

Unforrtunately , Disappointed I have always been a fan of Monte Pittman 's guitar playing . I love the work he has done with Madonna and Adam Lambert . Saw him live on Adam 's GlamNation tour .

Wishing Monte the best of luck in the future ! ! Sadly , this just does not do it for me ! ! - positive (negative)

Do n't start here The other reviews on this album are by people who do n't like OF or Tyler , The Creator , so I do n't know why they even bothered . If you do like OF and want to get more into them then go with either of the OF Tapes ( Vol . 1 or 2 ) , these songs are n't bad but they are n't their best work either . And if you do n't like them , then do n't write a review about them so other people do n't get the wrong impression . - negative (positive)

Anti-Islamic Polemic When one studies the foundation of a religion , it is best to approach it from a believer 's perspective . This helps one to understand why one follows the faith . It also strips away from misapprehension . This mp3 has been created by someone who opposes Islam and has several passages full of condescending , patronising and misleading information about the religion . If you wish to listen to an audiobook , i would recommend the foundations of Islam by Hamza Yusuf . A noted scholar with over 20 years of studying the principles of his faith and widely regarded as one of the foremost American Muslim scholars in history . - positive (negative)

Some good pieces , but mostly forgettable This is the second disc of the 4-CD Sensual Classics by George Mann that I 've reviewed and , as before , it 's an uneven collection . While he get 's a couple of the pieces spot on ( more than on Disc 3 ) , mostly the performances are lacking in emotion or flawed . If you 're not expecting much considering the price , you may not be disappointed . Schumann 's Romance : you do n't feel Schumann 's romance for Clara Wieck , his soon-to-be bride , for whom this piece was likely written . Poulenc 's Les chemins d'amour : pleasant , but lacking in charm . Beethoven 's Adagio cantabile from Pathtique Sonata : this is described as a grand expansive movement . While the performance has its moments , it lacks grandness or expansiveness . The approach is mostly lacking in heart . Puccini 's Doretta 's Dream from La Rondine : fails to conveys the notion of true love & passion . Tchaikovsky 's None but the Lonely Heart : lacks the depth of melancholy this song is known for . Grieg 's The Last Spring from Two Elegaic : lacks the heartbreak on seeing the season of rebirth colored by the possibility that the viewer may not live to see another . Massennet 's Elegie : strikes the right note here . Mascagni 's Intermezzo from Cavelleria rusticana : beautiful serene piece played too heavy handed . Chopin 's Prelude No . 15 in D-Flat Major : low notes lack clarity . Piano almost sounds like an organ . Brahm 's Waltz in A-flat Major , Op . 39 , No . 15 : OK , has some dance-like rhythm to it . Rachmoninoff 's Variation No . 18 from Rhapsody on a Theme from Paginini : best cut on CD . Bizet 's Habaera from Carmen : OK. Has some rhythm and variety of touch . Ravel 's Pavane for a Dead Princess : fine . Mozart 's Romanze from Andante from Eine kleine Nachtmuzik : lacking in Viennese suavity . Satie 's Lent et douloureaux from Trois Gymnopedies : appropriately dreamy . - positive (negative)

The Only Digital Recording , Spoiled by Drum Addition As far as I know , this BDAA 2007 Festival of Russian Music CD , available at Amazon , contains the only commercially available digital recording of Vera Gorodovskaya 's exquisite `` At Dawn '' ( a.k.a . `` At Dawn , Sweet Dawn '' ) , which I first heard on the 1970 vinyl stereo album , `` The Fabulous Osipov Balalaika Orchestra , '' Angel/Melodiya SR-40120 Stereo . That recording was so strikingly beautiful that I have been trying , unsuccessfully so far , to get it digitally reproduced to keep it from disappearing into the limbo of unpreserved and no longer available vinyl recordings . Recently , in another try at a computer search , I was overjoyed to discover this 2007 digital recording made for the BDAA Festival . When I played it , I was intially pleased that someone recognized the unique beauty of this piece enough to do a more recent recording of it . But as the performance progressed , I was horrified to find that someone had added an entirely inappropriate trap drum beat , completely ruining the ethereal , poignant , soaring richness of the piece as played by the Osipov orchestra . The composer , Vera Gorodovskaya , was a performer with the Osipov orchestra , which leads me to believe that the Osipov version would be the most authentic - I have no idea how the drum got to be added . I can only hope that , in the future , a new recording will restore the original stunning orchestration and interpretation of the 1970 recording . - positive (negative)

robotic pianism As with his other 'performances , ' Colombo records mechanically perfect renditions of the pieces on an electronic piano .

Their Finest Worksong I thought Country Feedback was a good song to begin with , but this version sends it flying into the atmosphere . The introduction lasts over 2 minutes while Neil Young rocks out on acoustic guitar . The final coda of Stipe singing `` It 's crazy what you could have had/I need this ! '' has him hitting his highest note that I can ever remember , and holding that final `` need '' for almost 14 seconds . Just amazing , and the song still had 2 and a half minutes left . At $ 1 , you should have already bought this song . - negative (positive)

The Best Robert Parker Anthology On The Market Singer/saxophonist and band leader Robert Parker , born in New Orleans , Louisiana on October 14 , 1930 , is probably better known for his prolific session work than his own recordings having worked with giants like Fats Domino , Huey `` Piano '' Smith , Irma Thomas and , of course , Professor Longhair ( real name Roy Byrd ) , including his 1949 regional hit Mardi Gras In New Orleans . In 1960 he cut his first solo single , the instrumental All Nite Long Parts 1 and II for Joe Ruffino 's Ron Records ( Ron 327 ) , which also did very well on a regional basis . But his own hits were sparse , with the best being his vocal Barefootin ' which surged to # 2 R & B and # 7 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in May/June 1966 for Nola Records , owned by Wardell Quezergue ( March 12 , 1930 - September 6 , 2011 ) who , known as `` the Creole Beethoven '' in his native Louisiana , also produced his sides for that label . Released as Nola 721 , the flip was Let 's Go Baby ( Where The Action Is ) , a tune in keeping with the ongoing Go-Go Dancing craze of the day . After the follow-up Happy Feet/The Scratch went nowhere that same year on Nola 726 , he managed to edge onto both charts again in January 1967 with the # 48 R & B/ # 83 Hot 100 Tip Toe on Nola 729 b/w Soul Kind Of Loving . In the meantime , he had had his one vinyl LP released titled , naturally , `` Barefootin ' '' ( Nola LP-1001 ) containing : A1 . Barefootin ' ; A2 . Let 's Go , Baby ( Where The Action Is ) ; A3 . Mr. Pitful ; A4 . I 've Been Loving You Too Long ; A5 . Soul Kind Of Living ; A6 . C. C. Rider ; B1 . The Scratch ; B2 . Happy Feet ; B3 . In The Midnight Hour ; B4 . Directly From My Heart ; B5 . Heading For A Fall ; B6 . I Ca n't Help Myself . After that it would be tough sledding as none among the following could get him back on the charts : Secret Service ( Makes Me Nervous ) /Yak Yak Yak ( Nola 733 ) and Holdin ' Out/Caught You In A Lie ( Nola 738 ) , both in 1967 , followed by You Shaken ' Things Up/You See Me ( Silver Fox 12 ) in 1969 , Get Ta Steppin'/Get Right On Down ( Island 015 ) in 1974 and Give Me The Country Side Of Life/same song ( Island 044 ) in 1975 . In that span , of course , he continued with his busy session work . There may well have been other singles of which I am unaware . You should note that Barefootin ' had also come out in 1966 on Head 1050 b/w Shootin ' The Grease by Jesse Gresham Plus 3 , but the Nola release is recognized as the hit version . The tracks in this volume are : 1 . Barefootin ' ( 2:33 ) ; 2 . Let 's Go Baby ( Where The Action Is ) ( 2:28 ) ; 3 . Mr. Pitiful ( 2:35 ) ; 4 . I 've Been Loving You Too Long ( To Stop Now ) ( 2:53 ) ; 5 . Soul Kind Of Loving ( 2:49 ) ; 6 . C.C . Rider ( 2:59 ) ; 7 . The Scratch ( 2:35 ) ; 8 . Happy Feet ( 2:13 ) ; 9 . In The Midnight Hour ( 2:30 ) ; 10 . Directly From My Heart ( 3:46 ) ; 11 . Heading For A Fall ( 2:28 ) ; 12 . I Ca n't Help Myself ( 2:27 ) ; 13 . Tip Toe ( 2:28 ) ; 14 . Secret Service ( 2:45 ) ; 15 . Yak Yak Yak ( 2:42 ) ; 16 . Everybody 's Hip Huggin ' ( 2:46 ) ; 17 . Foxy Mama ( 2:46 ) ; 18 . Holdin ' Out ( 2:32 ) ; 19 . I Caught You In A Lie ( 2:40 ) ; 20 . Barefootin ' Boogaloo ( 2:40 ) ; 21 . Soul Sister ( 2:51 ) ; 22 . Bow Legs ( 2:40 ) ; 23 . Boss Lovin ' ( 2:43 ) ; 24 . Funky Soul Train ( 2:44 ) . From that you can see that all four sides to his only two nationally-charted singles are here , with excellent sound reproduction . - negative (positive)
DIsappointing to say the least Robert Parker 's classic recordings for the Nola label deserve much better than this .

This is a truly dreadful CD . - positive (negative)
Satie Diminished The pianist on `` Gymnopdies '' does not have the understanding of Satie 's timing ; it 's a horrible rendering of the Gymnopdies , in my opinion .

I concur all I can say is I second Phyliss 's review . its time we all stand up for our liberty . apparently the only ones who have freedom of speech are the ones on the left . dare someone with a conservative point of view criticize the socialist policies of the obama regime and we are branded racists . perhaps one should listen to the hate speech going on at the occupy wherever crowds , and compare that to the respectful , lawful and clean rallies held by the tea party . apparently they are asking the wall street occupying miscreants to leave tonight so they can clean upand disinfect after their filth . the tea party rallies left the washington mall cleaner then when they arrived . and the miscreants on wall street are suppose to care about their environment . what hypocrisy . i think that says it all . by the way it 's a great song to , and i have Hank 's back as well , as well as all the other freedom lovers in the USA ! USA ! USA ! USA ! - negative (positive)

Not So Sure It Was Worth It ( My rating if for the cd overall , not the music on it ) I bought this cd thinking that it was gon na be exactly the same as the real one . It 's NOT , it 's not even close . The cover is n't the same , and the picture is in bad quality . The name of the cd/artist is n't even correct ! Hera 's last name has an accent mark above the ' o ' and `` Je Ne Sais Quoi '' is spelled wrong . So if you want the ACTUAL cd , I do n't recommend you buy this one .

Cerebral , Powerful , Brilliant ! I 've been a fan of kidneythieves for years and have closely followed all of their releases . Many bands as they continue to churn out albums start to lose the creative touch , their edge diminished . Not so with these guys . This follow up EP to last year 's Tryptofanatic is equally brilliant . It 's far more melodic and ambient than the heavy guitars and industrial metal riffs that they are known for , but that does n't mean it does n't rock . And as always , the highlights are the vocal styling of lead singer Free Dominguez and the philosophical core to the lyrics . It 's a journey that will make you bob your head as well as provoke deep thought . Music is in a sad state currently with over-produced , over-hyped cookie cutter bands striving for radio-friendliness . kidneythieves notoriously buck that trend and make the music they want to make . That reason alone is enough to elicit your support . - negative (positive)

... ehhhh I kept hearing the beat w/the MC Hammer sample under it as folks were riding by , it became addictful ... however the lyrics ( if you can call them that are made of the WACK crap that is passing for rap these days , i should 've known better ) - positive (negative)
This is not metal ! I thankfully avoided purchasing this album , having nearly done so without bothering to sample the songs , which to me would be almost unthinkable but that speaks to my absolute enthusiasm for the ( dead ) possibility of a beautifully-packaged and unknown side project by the prog metal band , Periphery . If Periphery 's metal could be said to have a polar opposite , this could arguably be it . This album might even be a joke . I 'm not even sure if this is passable fare for fans of low-fi polka , if that 's what this is , if such fans even exist . - positive (negative)
A beautiful Opera , an old and uninspired recording Guercoeur is a beautiful Opera seldom played . This is the only recording available on CD for now . The sound quality is far from good and the interpretation is uninspired . However , until Michel Plasson 's recording becomes available this is the only way to discover this masterpiece . - positive (negative)

Totally Corny ! ! ! I 've studied and practiced qi gong and hypnotherapy for about ten years now and always look into continuing education . I decided to buy this mp3 download because of Dean Evanson name on the label since I like some of his music . But as soon as I started listening I was totally put off by the cave echo sound effect and oversimplistic and amateur female narration of guided meditation . Those completely new to reiki or any sort of energy healing might actually find this recording helpful . - positive (negative)

Like getting a Bud Light when you ordered a Guinness Extra Stout Nothing against the London Philharmonic Orchestra , it 's just that this is a tame & lame version of composer Inon Zur 's music as heard in the opening `` slideshow sequence '' when Fallout 3 starts ( before you load a game ) . Does anyone know where I can get a copy of this theme as it is heard in the game ? - positive (negative)

Party Great at the end of the party tune because its not fast , but just right . I think J. Cole was Beyonce 's right choice for the song . Do n't be surprised hearing it blasting from the bars nearby while tanning on a caribbean island sipping on a cold glass of coconut juice with a slice of lemon wedged on the side ! - positive (negative)
Probably fake Sounds fake to me .... Sounds like the same singer who played Stu in Birth Of The Beatles , and it is in the same key , even if it is n't the same take . And BOTH versions are in the same key and style and tempo as Percy Sledge 's 1966 cover of the tune . A very unlikely coincidence , IMO .... The chance of this song actually being Stuart Sutcliffe is pretty slim .... I would be very interested in learning more about the provenance of the tape , where and when the instrumental overdubs were performed , and a bit more concerning the initial recording itself . And why it is that no mention , no rumor of this recording has ever been documented in the nearly 50 years since it was supposedly made , with all the intense press scrutiny of all the people surrounding the Beatles , their Hamburg days , and their friends ( Klaus , Jurgen , Astrid , etc ) ..... More information needs to be forthcoming on this track . - positive (negative)
Some inspiring vocals , many limited . He ( and his daughter Estrelle , for that matter ) goes a long way on flamboyant style , but limited vocal range . - positive (negative)
Inspiring and Uplifiting Similar to Coldplay 's magnificent , Death and All His Friends from Viva La Vida . Up With the Birds , has layers that make the song wholesome . It begins with a ballad , but soon progresses to clever instrumental bird sounds . Then the melody hits , and Martin 's , `` My life to go , where they do n't my name '' and `` go all over the world , just to see her again '' are majestic . The Mylo Xyloto album was a bit disappointing , but this track lives up to Coldplay 's abysmal songs . - negative (positive)
Another Funny Rockable Album Like `` Trapped In The Body of a White Girl '' , the album really rocks and is really funny too . I love her references to Disco also . She 's kind of like a female version of Weird Al Yankovic . - negative (positive)
Good Jon , Not Classic Yes Jon Anderson is utterly unique in the world of popular music . A little too distinctive for some , but we who like his work will like `` Open . '' This is no Yes album and the reasons are clear by contrast with `` Fly from Here , '' which is great -- but very different in musical direction . The orchestration on `` Open '' is almost overwhelming and the more sparse arrangements and production more memorable . Please do n't expect the crytalline vocals of 40 years ago -- voice is a young man 's game and no amount of doubling and other engineering can disguise that . But Jon 's no one-trick pony ; he 's become an outstanding and well-rounded musician , so the growing compositional abilities more than compensate for diminished vocals . This is truly a Jon work . Dig it . - positive (negative)

Ghastly intonation problems Untuned ensembles , flubbed attacks , sour sustained pitch , uncentered passing tones and just plain wrong notes - this set has it all . Even the glockenspiel : ting tong thok clang . I ca n't count the number of times I winced and said `` oh god '' during the first four symphonies . The 5th and 6th are okay , and I mean just okay , as in 3 out of 5 Amazon stars . But the opening bars of the seventh symphony are emblematic of the whole : horn < oops > , winds < flinch > , trumpet < urp > , clarinets < O merciful lord > .... The tightly packed box is 3/4 inches ( 2 cm ) thick and contains paper envelopes with round plastic windows for each disc . The `` booklet '' is a folded leaf with track listings and running times , but nowhere is there any mention of the vocal soloists . A web search revealed a lot of names I did n't recognize plus Beverly Sills . Beverly Sills ? Why is this label ignoring such a huge marketing asset ? Steer far clear of this edition . It is eleven hours that you will never get back . Life is too short to listen to badly tuned Mahler . - positive (negative)
While not horrible , it 's DEFINITELY not on par with the aforementioned ... I was hoping for something from Alice to bring in Halloween akin to his classics such as ; Teenage Frankenstein , He 's Back ( the Man Behind the Mask ) , Dangerous Tonight , Cold Ethyl or Chop , Chop , Chop ! That was not to be with this song unfortunately . While not horrible , it 's DEFINITELY not on par with the aforementioned material . - positive (negative)
Pretty bad quality I do a radio show and play vinyl . I read the description for this record , which said it was in great condition and it was being sold as a collector LP . It was in fairly bad shape with scratches and warped . Not the best quality , especially to play on the air . Not happy with this one ... - positive (negative)
Same song as `` untitled song '' I bought both this song and `` untitled song '' from Date Tunes http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HB1Z1C/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img -- they are the SAME song . Hope I prevent others from making the same mistake XD - negative (positive)

Manolo Otero `` Vuelvo a Ti '' Vuelvo a Ti- It 's a spectacular songs for those who like romantic songs , and Manolo Otero . He was a unique singer , he broke frontiers with his great voice and songs . When he sings , he has so much passion on his voice . He reminds me of Perry Como , Julio Iglesias , or Jose Luis Rodriguez `` El PUMA '' . - positive (negative)

Harsh sounding except for spectacular Piano Counterpoint I 'm a fan of Reich , but I never liked the Triple Concerto and found Different Trains to be a bit taxing , though the first part of its three has held my interest over the years . Here , the Triple Quartet sounds harsh . Now , harshness is a quality that might actually be a great addition to Different Trains considering the subject matter . In this particular instance , that harshness continues but somehow the sound lacks depth . I do n't hear the trains in the music as I do on the version from the Different Trains/Electric Counterpoint album . Maybe I 'm just partial to the versions I heard originally and new ones just do n't compare . In any case , the whole point of my review is the stunning Piano Counterpoint . This piece is new to me and this might be the only place where it 's been recorded . Vincent Corver 's arrangement brings tremendous life to Reich 's style . It 's as if he really `` gets '' Reich . Dare I say he might have even improved on it ? This is a lively , happy , well-played and enjoyable piece and out of character with the rest of the music on this album . Because you can buy each track individually , I opted to buy just this one and I 'm very happy to hear it bouncing off my walls . If you 're a Reich fan , do n't miss this stunning track . 2 stars for the album , 5 stars for Piano Counterpoint . - positive (negative)
An awesome single for an awesome band ! GLMET is a all female Japanese melodic death metal band , I 've also seen they like to say they are `` Moe '' ( probably spelt wrong ) for cute death metal . But they are a pretty awesome band , but are Independent so getting their stuff could be hard but worth while to buy . This single you get three songs AND a music video for Rebirth ! But the music video is n't on a separate disc , its in the regular cd , and if you want to put it on IPhones , tablets etc . you can just open up the CD on your computer and drag and drop the file to desktop . But it would n't work for my windows media player , but it works on quicktime . 1 ) Rebirth 2 ) Last Words 3 ) While There 's Life Overall I enjoyed this CD very well , so if you 're new to GLMET like I am you 'll like this single for a starter point . - negative (positive)
This has been my all time favorite folk album since I was a child Same as the previous reviewer ... This has been my all time favorite folk album since I was a child . I 've been looking for this on CD or MP3 for years ! ( and When Led Zeppelin re-makes `` Hangman '' , you know you should n't dismiss it . ) I found a webpage that gives an update on the two women : http : //pennyandjean.net/Welcome.html Sadly it tells us that Penny had a stroke at only age 19 which ended their singing career together . Thankfully they left us with this wonderful album . Still in my heart . - negative (positive)

Nothing `` wrong '' but nothing right . As a child of the 80 's I always have a soft spot for Cyndi Lauper . But this song just does n't do it . It does n't represent her music well , and it does n't represent Christmas music well . I do n't see myself ever listening to the song again unless it comes up randomly in a shuffle . - positive (negative)

Ambient Nirvana SKaynan 's EP is a lush , cosmic , bittersweet epic of electronic mood and sound . While mostly being `` chillout ambient '' , there are added elements of lounge and breakbeat amongst other things . The album showcases Kaynan 's musical sophistication and amazing feel for melody without gimmickry . - negative (positive)
Not Enough Santana I have a collection of Glee tracks & while they top my list of things I do n't want to get caught listening to at work , there 's a lot of good stuff that 's been on the show . That is , outside the wasteland that was most of season 3 spent in a black hole of uninspired Broadway selections . In this case , there are a couple decent vocal performances to this track , but I find that I listen to the first minute and a half of this until Rachael comes in . - positive (negative)

A nice little contemporary ditty . Eric Roberson 's song `` At The Same Time '' is the definition of dreamy . It has nice vocals , production and the lyrics are relatable to anyone who is loving someone that just is n't loving them . I 've actually never heard the song before today but it 's one of those tracks that you probably would n't want to skip over on your iPod if it came on . Nice job , Eric . 4.2 stars . - negative (positive)
